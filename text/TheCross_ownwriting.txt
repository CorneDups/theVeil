The Cross

The world with all it's glitter and gold, 
only seems to fuel an endless, empty, consuming hunger.
Sin keeps winning and chained my will,
the wages is death, eternal and still.

Yet, before light exploded from Your Word,
You already knew the cost of love.
To impart Your Spirit into man,
will leave eternal scars on the all powerful one.

The stories of old and shadows in past,
foretold of salvation from the Son of Man,
The unjust spilling of man's blood cries out to God,
and blood of animals used to pardon sin,
But no one thought about the Blood of God.
With my hands I swung the hammer...

My heart keeps choosing sin, a void that nothing seems to fill.
The Father looks through Mercy's eyes and longs for us to dance again.
So, came down, God Himself, to do what no man could do.
He loved and loved and loved, so much and in return He was put to death.

Unthinkable, insane and blasphemous the righteous would say:
God to die at the hands of His creation.
Sin and Death danced in the darkness, as Heaven grieved.
A hole in God? How can this be? Unless it's planned since eternity.
In three days, a new creation started.
Resurrected Life now reigns where sin and death once called home.

Through this hole, His Blood flowed free and washed my sins away.
He looks at me, with eyes so kind and hands stretched wide.
'Take My hand and let Me show you Life'

The Blood of God has made a way, telling me I was worth it all.




Song:

[Verse 1 - Soft, reflective piano with subtle strings]
The world with all its glitter and gold
Stirs up a hunger deep in my soul
Sin wraps chains around my will
And death lies waiting, silent and still

[Pre-Chorus - Swelling harmonies, building intensity]
But long before Your Word lit the sky
You saw the cost—love reaching so high
To breathe Your Spirit into fragile man
Would carve eternal scars in the Great I AM

[Chorus - Full band, soaring orchestration, deep emotional weight]
Oh, the Cross, the Cross, where mercy bled for me
Love poured out so fiercely, it set this captive free
The Blood of God has made a way
Proving I was worth it all
At the Cross—where chains would fall

[Verse 2 - Slight build, more movement, heavier emotions]
The stories of old had whispered Your plan
That salvation would come by the Son of Man
They shed the blood of beasts to pardon sin
But who imagined God’s own blood stepping in?
And with my trembling hands, I swung the hammer down
As all of heaven wept, nails echoed through the ground

[Chorus - Powerful reprise, lifting the melody higher]
Oh, the Cross, the Cross, where mercy bled for me
Love poured out so fiercely, it set this captive free
The Blood of God has made a way
Proving I was worth it all
At the Cross—where chains would fall

[Verse 3 - Passionate, building intensity, raw vocals]
My heart keeps choosing sin—a void I cannot fill
Still the Father sees me through mercy, calling my name still
So He came down Himself to do what no man could
He loved and loved and loved, and we nailed Him to the wood

[Bridge - Dramatic build, haunting echoes, climactic strings]
Unthinkable, insane: that God would die by our hands
Darkness danced with sin and death, yet heaven had a plan
In three days, new creation rose where death had staked its claim
Resurrected life now reigns—no longer bound by shame

(Pause—brief instrumental drop, lone violin, soft heartbeat-like percussion)

[Chorus (Extended) - Final climax, full choir, soaring orchestration]
Oh, the Cross, the Cross, where mercy bled for me
Love poured out so fiercely, it set this captive free
The hole in God poured healing grace,That washed my sins away
The Blood of God has made a way—And I was worth it all,
I was worth it all

[Outro - Soft, fading, gentle piano and strings]
He looks at me with tender eyes, His arms stretched open wide
“Take My hand—let Me show you life,” the Savior gently cries
The Blood of God has made it right, no more fear of the fall
At the Cross, where He proved I was worth it all.

(Soft, fading, echo of a whisper: "I was worth it all.")
