Part 14: Returning Home, Changed

After hearing Henk’s story, I started digging

Searching for any updates on Rev. Hayden and the cult.

What I found shook me.

It had been four years since I left.

And in that time, everything had changed.

Rev. Hayden had left the cult.

He publicly declared that he could no longer support Hicks' teachings.

The result?

A massive split in the church.

For the first time in decades,

The Message movement fractured.

Some followed Hayden in his new direction.

Others

Some even born into the Message

Left completely.

Many of them found new lives in traditional churches.

They were finally free from Hicks.

I was ecstatic.

But I also knew…

Something big must have happened.

Splits like this don’t occur without pain.

Maybe it was a natural break.

Maybe it was something worse.

I didn’t have all the answers.

But for once

That didn’t matter.

They were free.

Scattered Butterflies

Heinrich had left South Africa.

He moved to Beijing

Where he found great success as a teacher.

He helped equip students for engineering studies.

He travelled the world

Experiencing a life he never could have lived

Inside the Message.

And it wasn’t just him.

One by one, the brothers and sisters I had once called family

Broke free.

They were living their own stories now.

Stories of new beginnings.

Stories of healing.

Stories of transformation.

Like butterflies leaving their cages.

But…

They never spoke to me again.

I learned of their freedom

Only through social media.

Through whispers from mutual connections.

I often wondered…

Did they struggle like I did?

Did they face the same darkness

The same depression

The same crushing loneliness?

I suspect they did.

Leaving a cult isn’t just about walking away.

It’s about unlearning everything

You once believed to be true.

Maybe one day, in eternity,

I’ll hear their stories too.

Maybe even John’s.

Maybe even Reuben’s.

Was It Real? Or Just Madness?

I’ve often asked myself:

What was real?

What was deception?

During my mania…

Was God speaking?

Or was it only my own delusions?

The answer?

A little of both.

Not everything I saw and heard was from God.

My own heart, my self-deception, my repressed needs—

They all mingled together.

And maybe

Even something darker was at work.

But does that prevent God from speaking

Through the chaos?

No, He is far bigger than my madness.

Far greater than my failures.

And somehow…

Even in the middle of my psychotic storm

He was still there.

Some things were real.

Some things were illusions.

But one thing is certain

Jesus Never Left Me

Looking back, I see it so clearly.

Before every struggle,

God sent messages

Visions to prepare me.

In every dark place,

He placed people in my path

A safety net to catch me.

Because He knew…

I was going to blame Him.

I now believe

That out of everyone in the Potchefstroom church,

I was the only one

Who had enough support to survive.

I had:

✅ Loving parents

✅ Friends outside the Message

✅ Resources to rebuild

✅ A support system beyond the cult

I had a chance to escape.

To heal.

To find Jesus again.

A New Life

By 2016, something inside me shifted.

I started experiencing a revival.

Not because of a church.

Not because of a leader.

Not because of spiritual gifts.

But because Jesus found me again.

This time

Without performance.

Without pressure.

Without fear.

In July 2016, I publicly shared my story

As part of a television series on cults, called Openbaring.

One week after the recording

Berniece Hicks passed away.

At 99 years old.

The woman who had once controlled so many lives

Was now gone.

And yet…

Jesus remained.

Even today

Some days are hard.

Sometimes, He feels far away.

But when I quiet my thoughts

He is still there.

The Only Thing That Matters

For years, I chased spiritual knowledge.

I sought visions.

I sought gifts.

I sought power.

And yet

None of those things compare

To the simple embrace of Jesus.

When He wraps His arms around me

And whispers inaudibly:

"I love you."

"No matter how far you run."

"No matter how much you sin."

"I pursue you. I save you."

"I love you, My Bride."

"For all of time and beyond."

The Final Question

So, Is there more to life than what we see?

After everything,

After all the madness

My answer is YES.

But what exactly is this mystery?

Now, that is a question worth living out.

I now believe

The mystery is most visible at the Cross.

Where Divinity and Eternity

Were nailed together

With Humanity and Time.

And yet

The mystery remains.

And my life will keep searching for the answer

Until the last time, my earthly heart beats.

A Final Word to You, Dear Reader

Just as He pursued me

He is pursuing you.

Not just the good parts of you.

Not just the parts that have it all together.

But your whole being.

Your beauty and your brokenness.

Your light and your darkness.

And only He

Can truly love you unconditionally.

The End… and a New Beginning.



John 10:27-29

“My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me, for my Father has given them to me, and he is more powerful than anyone else, No one can snatch them from the Father’s hand.”
