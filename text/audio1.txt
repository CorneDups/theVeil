Part 1: An Ordinary World

Have you ever felt that there must be more to life than what is seen? A call to something bigger, yet mysterious? As I enter my second decade of life, I am too busy to dwell on these questions. Engineering classes, projects, homework, tests, and deadlines consume my time. Most of my days are spent on campus, returning home only to sleep in my cozy little 12-square-meter room.

"I'm too busy for love"—that would be my answer to the age-old question about finding a wife and settling down. Maybe if I said it enough, I would start believing it, and the secret longing would disappear. Yet, secrets tend to grow when left in the dark corners of the soul.

I love the idea of reading—basking in the knowledge and wisdom of great minds. However, I am not a fast reader. I read slowly, but I make up for it by exploring a book’s depths. So when I read The Shack by William P. Young, I heard that mysterious question—the call to an authentic, life-giving relationship with God. But is this only a fantasy I wish were real? Or can it be a reality I live with every day? Does God truly love me as much as the Bible says?

At twenty, I didn’t know what love was, yet my desire to love and be loved unconditionally had been on my mind since I was a boy. If this love is real, I thought, there must be some people somewhere who are living this way with Him.

At 21:00, I was still working on a calculus assignment when a familiar knock on the door happily interrupted me. Heinrich often dropped by my room for coffee and conversation. He was a tall, friendly giant studying pedagogical engineering—essentially, training to become a high school educator. He had a peculiar laugh that put everyone at ease and made them feel free to be themselves. He also had a deep love for animals, even the unlovable ones, spiders and snakes included.

Over the past few months, our conversations had changed. Heinrich had begun talking more about God, his relationship with Jesus, and how he had experienced a profound transformation. He spoke of biblical mysteries that he was only beginning to scratch the surface of. My interest must have been obvious because I begged him to let me join one of their Bible studies until he finally, though reluctantly, agreed.

Heinrich’s transformation was intriguing. Unlike most people who claim to have changed, his walk was stronger than his talk. In our first year of university, Heinrich had been the typical student—going out with friends every other night, pushing the limits of his liver with alcohol, and doing whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted. But now, he was attending Bible studies, going to church services, and avoiding alcohol entirely. More than that, he genuinely cared about others—including me—in a way that felt sincere.

I was convinced that whatever he was experiencing was more real than any other transformation I had seen. Could there be something more? If so, I wanted it too.

Part 2: Hearing the Call

Until now, dreams and imagination have been my longest and dearest friends, especially in times of isolation—whether by circumstance or choice. A vivid dream I had as a pre-teen has always felt like a call to something more.

In the dream, I was on my way to school, yet my parents were sad and crying as they watched me leave. You see, this was no ordinary school day. It was my last. The school grounds were covered with large wooden crosses, and a few children were chosen to sacrifice their lives. I chose to be one of them. I chose to take up a cross.

As I died in the dream, I suddenly found myself in a long line of people and angels, all moving toward a portal ahead. Just as I was about to step into the glowing purple ring of light, I turned to the angel standing beside it and asked, “Am I going to heaven?”

His answer has haunted me ever since: “I don’t know.”

Throughout that week, I began noticing the number 333 everywhere. I would glance at my watch to find it was 3:33 PM, or I’d open my chemistry book only to land on page 333. At the same time, Heinrich’s conversations stirred a growing desire in me to attend Sunday night services at my church.

Toward the end of one such service, the speaker invited the congregation to turn to one another and share meaningful verses. The couple in front of me looked at me thoughtfully and said they felt Jeremiah 33:3 was meant for me:

“Ask me, and I will tell you remarkable secrets you do not know about things to come.”

The verse shook me. Was God making me a promise—perhaps even speaking directly to me? If I called on Him, He would answer and reveal things beyond my imagination. It felt like confirmation. Maybe Heinrich’s upcoming Bible study was part of that answer.

The study was held in a large, open room on campus, which only made the small group gathered there feel even smaller. As I stepped inside, two things struck me immediately.

First, the two women present wore long skirts and had their long hair tied up, with no makeup—something I had not expected. But second, and far more overwhelming, was the love, sincerity, and honesty in every word they spoke—especially when they spoke to me.

The study focused on the end times. The teacher, Joel, spoke with eloquence and wisdom, seamlessly weaving together verses and concepts to form a striking pattern of knowledge and understanding. Everything he shared was new to me, yet it felt deeply revelatory.

In just forty minutes, I saw the Bible come together like a puzzle, unlocking profound meaning and truth I could live by.

I hadn’t realized how hungry I was for deep, meaningful teachings about God—until I received them.
