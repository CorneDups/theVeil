Part 13: Death and Resurrection

These questions were too much.

Most of the time, when I prayed, I prayed for death.

I just wanted God to come and take me away.

Death felt sweet.

I wished 2012 had been my last year on Earth.

That there was nothing left to live for.

But my family and friends kept reminding me,

"There’s still so much to life."

"So many meaningful things to pursue."

Their hope was inspiring.

It gave me fuel.

But I couldn’t live on their hopes.

I needed my own.

As the weeks passed,

I fell further and further behind on my Master's work.

I slept longer and longer hours.

The depression consumed more and more of me.

At least in my dreams, I was free.

Free from the crater in my heart and mind.

Free from the aftermath of the chaos flower explosion.

Some days, I slept till 3 PM.

Ate something small.

And then went back to bed by 5 PM.

Nobody really knew.

I lived alone.

And the lack of structure in my studies,

Let me get away with it.

For now.

I avoided driving around Potchefstroom.

I didn’t want to risk running into anyone from the church.

Especially not Reuben.

Especially not John.

I still wanted to talk to John.

But he had blocked me on WhatsApp.

I still yearned for intimacy with him.

But I knew he hated me.

And I deserved it.

He clearly did not share my attraction to men.

Even though I knew the church was full of deceit,

I still wanted to go back.

At least there,

I felt close to God.

I felt meaning.

I felt direction.

I felt truth.

Now,

All I felt was hopelessness.

Whenever I thought about my past, present, or future.

Letting Go of My Master’s Degree

By mid-2013, I finally dropped out of my Master's program.

I couldn’t focus.

Couldn’t produce any meaningful work.

My gracious supervisor listened patiently.

He understood.

And he released me,

So that I could go work in Johannesburg.

At least there,

I could be away from the darkness of Potchefstroom.

The vision of the butterfly being freed,

Now felt like a foolish child’s imagination.

Most of my former brothers and sisters were still in the church.

Rev. Hayden never tore the church in two.

John and I never switched places.

It was all madness.

None of it was real.

I decided,

It was all psychosis.

And I needed to bury it.

Forget about it.

But the more I tried to forget,

The more atheistic I became.

There must be no God.

I had wanted Him.

And He gave me a cult.

What a sick joke.

If He did exist,

Then He must be sadistic.

He must enjoy fooling and punishing us.

Or,

He simply did not exist at all.

I settled on the latter.

Because the first option,

Required too much hatred.

And my broken heart couldn’t sustain it.

I stopped believing that God and love were the same.

Maybe it was better for me to stop trying to please Him.

Or even seek Him at all.

Escaping Into Johannesburg

In 2014, I started working in Johannesburg.

Fortunately,

My work was high-pressure.

All. The. Time.

It forced me to focus.

And the clean slate of new people, new places, and new routines,

Allowed me to be something other than broken.

Nobody in Joburg knew my past.

They didn’t know,

That I was a broken-brained, broken-hearted, fat, bald, gay man,

Who had been fooled by a cult.

They didn’t know.

And I wanted to keep it that way.

I started going out to drink almost every night.

Explored the city with my work friends.

I let sinful thoughts and behaviors grow.

Why would I stop them?

Trying to stop them,

Had led me into a cult.

Had created a crater in my soul.

So I rebelled.

And I blamed God.

Even though I also believed He didn’t exist.

But the same questions that started my journey,

Wouldn’t leave me alone.

I didn’t want to care about them.

But still,

I did.

Slowly, Jesus Pursued Me

Over the next two years,

New challenges arose.

New discoveries were made.

I grew in my work ability.

Which helped me see,

That my brain was less broken than I believed.

I threw myself into work.

But slowly,

I started exploring those questions again.

Not by choice.

But by chance.

No matter how much I tried to run away,

Jesus kept leaving little notes along my path.

Patiently,

Melting small pieces of my frozen heart.

My journey back to Jesus—

Was not straight.

Not predictable.

Not formulated.

It didn’t happen because of my works.

It happened because of His pursuit of my heart.

I started realizing,

That God was the One pursuing me,

Not the other way around.

It had always been this way.

I had fooled myself into thinking I was longing for Him.

But in truth,

It was His longing for me,

That was pulling me back.

Once I became open to that idea,

My heart of ice began to melt faster.

Healing and an Unexpected Revelation

God healed my mind.

And in partnership with psychologists and psychiatrists,

I slowly reduced my medication.

Until I could fully function without it.

By early 2016, I visited Henk Stoker for a catch-up.

He had a story to share.

One that would change everything.

Henk owned a small, double-story home,

A cosy place near the university campus.

Prime real estate.

His wife was a nurse, just like Yollande.

She was always busy, always saving lives.

Henk had five children.

All grown.

Even some grandchildren.

They were his pride and joy.

And his love for them,

Felt like a small reflection of the Father’s love.

I sat down on his soft brown couch.

The aroma of fresh filter coffee filled the room.

A plate of Ouma rusks sat on the table.

After some small talk,

Henk leaned forward, his eyes glinting with energy.

"I have an interesting story to tell you," he said.

I took a sip of coffee.

Listened.

A few months ago, he had been invited to an international seminar in America.

A conference on apocryphal studies.

Scholars from all over the world were attending.

Henk had been asked to give a short talk,

On a recent cult movement.

He decided to talk about our cult.

The Message.

He prepared diligently.

Studied Yollande’s notes.

Reviewed his own research.

And crafted a carefully structured argument.

But then,

Two days before the conference,

A blizzard hit.

Heavy snow blanketed the roads.

Travel became dangerous.

The conference organizers had no choice,

But to postpone the event.

On the morning of the conference,

One of the organizers went to the venue,

Just in case someone missed the cancellation.

There was one person waiting.

A short man,

Freezing from the cold.

But with a determined look in his eyes.

He had driven through hours of blizzard,

Just to attend.

Feeling terrible,

The organizer invited him home.

That Sunday morning,

They took him to their local church service.

As a consolation,

They asked Henk to deliver a shortened version of his talk.

Henk agreed.

He stood at the pulpit,

And shared the truth about the Message.

He explained, with love,

How small twists in the Gospel create cults.

How subtle manipulations can trap people.

After the service, the short man approached him.

His eyes were wide with shock.

"I need to know more," he said.

"I’m in this Message."

Henk listened, surprised.

The man continued:

"I’m one of the big leaders in this movement."

"But something happened recently," he admitted.

"And I’ve started doubting Hicks' teachings."

Henk had brought Yollande’s notes with him.

They contained detailed documentation,

Of all the ways the Message twisted Scripture.

He handed the notes over.

The man was stunned.

"There’s nothing like this in America," he said.

Henk then asked,

"Do you remember his name?"

I paused, deep in thought.

"I don’t know many people from America," I said.

"But… was his last name Hayden?"

Henk’s eyes lit up.

"Yes!" he said.

"That’s him!"

I sat in shock.

The very man I had once believed,

Was trying to awaken the Beast.

Had now been led to the truth,

By a series of impossible coincidences.

The notes Yollande and I compiled,

Had somehow reached Rev. Hayden.

Not by force.

Not by confrontation.

Not by any plan of ours.

But by God’s own design.

Henk leaned back, smiling.

"Isn’t that amazing?" he said.

I barely whispered my response.

"Yes… it is."

Something shifted inside me.

For the first time in years,

I felt a small glimmer of faith.

A tiny ember,

Flickering back to life.

Maybe…

Just maybe,

God had never stopped working.

Even when I couldn’t see it.

Even when I thought He had abandoned me.

He had been moving behind the scenes,

Setting things in motion long before I knew it.

This wasn’t chance.

This wasn’t random.

This was God’s hand.

And suddenly,

For the first time in a long, long time,

I dared to hope again.
