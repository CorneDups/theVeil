Part 3: A Crossroad—Which Way Is the Right Way?

I wanted more and I got it.

My first Sunday service left me shaken. I had eagerly walked forty minutes to get there, carried by my expectations, only to find a small congregation of about twenty people. The pastor, Reuben, was young—just seven years older than me. His two younger brothers, Jaco and John, were also part of the group.

John, Heinrich, and I were the same age, yet John was my complete opposite. His jokes never ended, and his constant smile made me want to smile, too—yet something about him felt off. I struggled to connect with him. There was a sense of pretense or disguise, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. The reason, however, would become clearer in time.

The service began with prayer.

Everyone knelt—either on the floor or on their chairs. A few moments later, I started hearing strange languages. Fortunately, Heinrich had prepared me for this; it was called speaking in tongues. My time at the local AGS church had exposed me to it before, so I wasn’t entirely unfamiliar. I found myself both fascinated and envious of this gift I did not yet have.

Then the music started.

I was taken aback when these conservatively dressed people suddenly began dancing, waving their arms, and expressing joy, hope, and exaltation. I had always struggled to lift my hands in church, so this display of uninhibited worship was new to me. As the music swelled, so did the energy of the congregation—or perhaps it was the other way around.

Then, something happened that I could hardly believe.

The woman next to me had long black hair, nearly reaching her feet. At some point, she loosened it and began swinging her head from side to side. Her movements grew more intense, like a powerful pendulum. Her hair whipped violently from left to right, sometimes brushing against my skin.

Suddenly, piercing screams filled the air—like a woman in labor. My senses were overwhelmed. My ears rang from the noise.

Then, to crown the experience, Reuben and John began screaming as well. They punched at the air like boxers and stomped their feet violently.

My body tensed. My feet were ready to run.

Half-raising my hands in the air, I whispered a desperate prayer: God, please protect me from this.

And then, as suddenly as it had begun, it stopped.

The sounds and movements became tolerable again, and the congregation took their seats.

Reuben stood up and began preaching. Yet, I remember nothing of what he said. Not just because I was still trying to process what had just happened, but because his words, symbols, and concepts were entirely beyond my comprehension. He even used Hebrew symbols and roots to explain ideas. The congregation would shout in agreement to Hebrew words I couldn’t even pronounce.

Later, I learned that they called their teachings the Message for the Bride. They assured me that, at first, it wouldn’t make sense—but if I kept coming, understanding would come. They also referred to it as the Crucified Way, a path for those who chose to take up their cross.

Take up their cross… Like in my childhood dream?

When I got home, it felt like I had experienced PTSD. I kept hearing the screams, seeing the wild movements—what they called demonstrations—every time I closed my eyes. I told myself I would never go back.

But then—what about Heinrich’s transformation?

What about the dream? The verse?

What about the undeniable authenticity of the love these people seemed to have for God—something I had never witnessed before?

Maybe the truth would feel like a lie if I had been living lies—or, at best, limited truths—my whole life.

More importantly, maybe God needed to intervene this forcefully to fix me. Many of my desires were abominations to God, weren’t they? If so, my heart must be in desperate need of fixing.

The decision weighed heavily on my mind and heart.

I understood that choosing to go back meant more than just attending another service—it meant picking up this cross. It meant surrendering to this transformation.

I stood on the edge of a cliff, uncertain if this was safe.

But I trusted Heinrich.

I wanted to experience the love they radiated and grow in the knowledge that overflowed from their teachings.

So, I decided to go again.

Part 4: Crossing the Threshold Into Another World

The next service had similar events, but this time, it felt better than the first. By the third service, on Heinrich’s 20th birthday, I asked to be baptized by fire. This meant that the congregation would lay hands on me and pray for me to receive my unique language. I felt only one word—nothing more came—but they assured me that if I remained faithful to this single word, more would come.

The year drew to a close, and I spent the summer holidays away from the church, returning to my parents and siblings in Parys. I spent that time mulling over my experiences and the teachings I had received—intrigued, surprised, scared, and excited all at once.

At the start of the following year, I began attending the church sporadically, hopping between different congregations. One Sunday afternoon, I received a call from Reuben. He asked why I wasn’t committing fully. I told him I liked going to different places.

His response was direct: the more I missed, the more I would fall behind, and they couldn’t wait for me. It was my choice whether I wanted to join, but I needed to decide.

I was devastated. It felt like I wasn’t just disappointing Reuben—I was disappointing God Himself.

After silently praying and crying over it, I contacted Reuben and told him I would commit. He then recommended two things: baptism by water and attending the upcoming Easter Conference. I agreed to both.

Before confirming, however, I asked him if John would be at the conference. I wanted to understand why I struggled to connect with him. Reuben said John would be there. That settled it—I was going too.

The conference was beyond description.

Imagine my first church service multiplied by a hundred.

An international teacher, Rev. Hayden, was there—a middle-aged American man of short stature but immense conviction. He taught about birthing the eternal child within us, the child who understands the different eternities.

Every night, I slept in a small two-man tent I had purchased the week before. Another preacher spoke about growing in the Spirit, instructing us that if our spiritual gifts weren’t manifesting, we should fake it till we make it. My one word in tongues had remained solitary, and I desperately wanted more.

I spent a lot of time around John but still couldn’t connect with him. He was an extrovert; I was a terrible introvert. I tried to imitate his words in the spirit of fake it till you make it.

By the end of the three-day Easter Conference, I felt like a different being—not just in mind, but as if my paradigms, heart, and soul had shifted.

I decided to commit fully to the Crucified Way.

This meant enrolling in the beginner school teachings of the Tabernacle in the Form of the Cross and beginning the process of sanctifying my clothing, my hands, my eyes, and my mind.

The journey of holiness required separation from the world and complete devotion to God.

Christianity had always seemed so easy.

Jews followed strict laws, Muslims had even more, and Hindus observed rituals to elevate themselves to a higher plane in each reincarnation. But Christianity—at least the version I knew—taught that all one needed to do was believe in Jesus Christ to be saved. No effort was required.

As a boy, I had often imagined that I could indulge in as much sin as I wanted, wring every drop of pleasure out of life, and then—just before I died—choose to believe in Jesus. Wouldn’t I then have the same eternal outcome as someone who had lived righteously all their life?

Somehow, that never felt quite right.

Besides, if I truly believed in Jesus, why was my heart still so full of evil desires?

What about the Old Testament—the strange rituals, the sacred artifacts? How did they connect to Christianity? It seemed as if much of the Bible was just history—nothing more.

Then I began learning about the Tabernacle in the Form of the Cross and how it outlined the path of a Christian.

There was a map to being a Christian?

Even more astonishing was the discovery that there was more to Jesus than just salvation.

One of the church books had a depiction of the Tabernacle from the Old Testament. I learned that the day I decided to follow Jesus and repented of my sins was like the Israelites in Egypt sacrificing a lamb—mirroring the Brazen Altar in the Tabernacle.

I had accepted Jesus’ sacrifice—His blood for my sins.

The next step? Israel passed through the Nile, a parallel to the Laver in the Tabernacle—baptism by water, signifying death to the flesh and new life in God.

The cloud by day and fire by night that guided Israel reflected the smoke and fire from the Brazen Altar, symbolizing the Baptism of the Holy Spirit—the moment when I would receive my new language.

Beyond the outer court, the Holy Place contained three items:

The Golden Lampstand, with its 66 emblems, represented the 66 books of the Bible and the Law given on Mount Sinai. The Bible was our light on the path of the soul.

The Table of Shewbread symbolized nourishment, much like the manna that fell in the wilderness, feeding the Israelites—just as God’s Word nourishes the soul.

The Golden Altar of Incense represented deeper levels of spiritual demonstration, drawing closer to the heart of God.

And then there was the final step—the Holy of Holies, where the Ark of the Covenant covered God’s glory. This paralleled Israel passing over the Jordan into the Promised Land.

This was where the Bride resided.

If I reached this place, I would be part of the Bride of Christ—a special group of believers singled out because they followed the Bible’s pattern and loved God more than all others.

Finally, I would no longer be an abomination to Him.

A hidden, unspoken desire within me compelled me to climb this mountain faster than anyone.

Silently, I believed that the closer I came to the Holy of Holies, the closer I was to healing my desires.

I was ready to walk through the wilderness, to reach the Holies, to learn about the Candlestick, the Table of Bread, and—most intriguing of all—the Altar of Incense, the demonstrations in the Spirit.

The year before joining the church, I had worked through the New Testament, studying a piece each night, making it my own.

Now, I replaced that time with studying sermon notes.

Notes from Rev. Hicks, the Word Prophet of our era.

There was only one Word Prophet alive at a time, and we were blessed to have her.

She constantly shared new insights, knowledge, and experiences through these notes.

With each sermon I studied, I prayed for the same experiences.

I prayed for a new heart, a new tongue, and a new mind.

I diligently studied the different eternities, the sixteen different minds, and how to calm them.

Patterns of two, three, four, seven, and twelve existed throughout the Bible and reality.

My head swelled with knowledge. Sermons began to make sense—just as I had been promised.

I felt a lamp illuminating my way forward.

I started fasting more frequently—until fasting every Wednesday became routine.

I learned that hunger is not always physical—it can be spiritual.

For most of my life, I had filled that hunger with natural food, when what I truly needed was spiritual nourishment.

Hunger, I discovered, could escort a person deeper into God.

I was getting used to living in the Holies.

My appetite for knowledge had always been high—but now, I was delving into the daunting, ethereal ways of the Spirit.

Raising just half a hand during services revealed how little of the Holy Spirit I had embraced.

But I wanted to understand the Altar of Incense.

And the only way to learn was to participate in the prayer meetings.

Prayer meetings were like that part of my first service before Reuben started preaching. But imagine that with all the lights off, everyone making sounds, pulsing rhythms, and screaming for two to three hours. The first time I attended one, I was horrified. I remember closing my eyes and thinking that it sounded like a zombie apocalypse. But I was taught not to judge what I did not understand, and that in time, these things would become clear. So, I remained open. I slowly learned that every movement, growl, and punch was biblically sound. The Bible was full of people screaming in anger, fear, anguish, joy, or travail; people falling into trances or collapsing; clapping hands, dancing, saints seemingly hitting the air, and the authority we have been given to trample over snakes. Intercession was the next level of the Holy Spirit baptism. The spirit makes intercession for us to God with groanings that cannot be uttered, which is precisely how it sounded at prayer meetings and how the Bible describes it in Romans chapter 8. The simplest way to explain the intercession sound is like a sheep baa-ing. But it feels like something vibrating in your stomach and mouth. "Fake it till you make it," was my unspoken motto for months, until one night when I truly felt it.

By this time, I had probably been in the church for about eight months. We had purchased a tiny church building on the corner of the old part of Potchefstroom. More than 80 people would struggle to stand in the church, but we were happy with about 30. Each of us had duties, like cleaning the carpets and mowing the lawn. We breathed new life into the quaint little church, perhaps more than it had ever felt. I parked my 1985 Toyota Corolla outside the church and climbed out, wearing a long-sleeved shirt and pants, a bottle of water in one hand and a small towel in the other. I might have looked like I was going for a gym workout, and there would have been some truth to that. As I entered the outer court, I exchanged greetings with the family. Each person had become like family to me. By now, I had cried with them, suffered with them, shouted for joy, and shared a singular, peculiar vision: to be the Bride of Christ. I greeted every brother with a heartfelt hug and every sister with a handshake, to avoid problems of sexual arousal that could interfere with our prayers. When I hugged John, it was always too short, but I enjoyed his fresh, clean, and energizing aroma. A few minutes later, we entered the small entryway of the church. I would silence my phone, take off my shoes, and put all my valuables away. The room was filled with twilight as the day drew to an end. I went to my knees to start praying. Like most of us, I began with ordinary language and let it progress to my unknown language. By now, I had a set of probably 30 words, none of which I understood.

Reuben would take the microphone and start leading us in prayer, sometimes priming us with a word or giving us direction. Violet played the piano with beautiful skill, creating a calm and loving atmosphere, while John played the drums. The drums accentuated the piano notes and provided rhythm as our prayers grew louder. The room slowly filled with the murmuring of unknown languages and groans. By now, these sounds had become familiar to me, almost like the sound of home. In my mind, I often tried to focus on something I had read in the notes about prayer or praying for certain people, or myself. Often, I would ask for an even deeper relationship with Jesus, that He would take me deeper, for authenticity, and for the breaking down of pride in my heart. I had been trying to experience travail, part of the Tabernacle’s Altar of Incense, for a long time. So, I kept praying for it. The groans began moving into growls, while the drums' rhythm built toward a crescendo. By now, the room was completely dark, except for the small LED lights from the electronics. One of my sisters began interceding louder, and another entered travail. Some of my brothers began swinging from left to right, in rhythm with the drum and the melody of the piano. I didn’t need to see them; I heard them, and I felt them. While the teachings, notes, and sermons were well-ordered, prayer meetings were turbulent, flowing, and pregnant with an unknown gift.

Reuben began speaking. With a shortened but determined breath, he commanded, “The Word Prophet, Reverend Hicks, is under attack and needs our prayers. Let us take this burden upon us and stand in the gap.” The prayer warriors began groaning louder, and some of their heads swung with increasing intensity. I, too, felt the stirring inside and swung from left to right. Here, prayer involved your whole body, not just a thought or a word. My body began synching with my family, and we moved in unison. Like a group of birds swarming as one entity, I became one with the group as we focused our prayers on pushing through the darkness. This darkness was not the lack of light in the room, but a darkness that felt confusing, sucking the life out of us, and trying to stop us. Like dark enemies lurking in the shadows. Like an invisible ceiling, we were trying to pray through. Suddenly, thunder erupted as Heinrich’s giant foot hit the floor, and a jolt went through me. I felt the same nudge to start stomping and head-banging. With each drumbeat, another foot stomp was added. As the foot stomps grew louder, the screams grew louder too. By now, the temperature in the room had started rising, and I rolled up the long sleeves of my shirt to expose the perspiration on my arms. “Keep pushing!” Reuben would barely get in, as he was in full demonstration force as well. I began thinking about Reverend Hicks. I thought about how much she had sacrificed, at more than 90 years of age, how tired she must be to still be teaching, and how much she needed the Lord's strength. My energy flared up even more, and I entered a bout of head-banging. Every time the drum would beat, my head would violently swing to the floor, and at the next beat, fly to the sky, then back to the floor and sky in rhythm. Heinrich grabbed my hand, and we moved as one. Each time our heads went down, our locked hands would hit the air. The dynamic movements continued for about two minutes, then the piano started playing off-tones, and the drums expanded their rhythmic range. The next moment, Reuben grabbed my other hand, and I saw that the whole church had formed a circle. Hand in hand, brothers connected to brothers and sisters to sisters, and the married couples merged us into one. Everyone exerted powerful and energetic movements, and rhythmic sounds, like one creature. Sweat dropped from everyone's face. With every swing Heinrich made, salty droplets flew across the room. The women’s hair became like a dancing cloud of whips. I felt that we were pressing against the darkness and were about to pierce it. Just then, Reuben burst into a violent fit of punching and stomping, called a rebuke, which felt like a jolt of energy pulsing through me, and I began rebuking too. A chain reaction was set off. The drums were playing so fast that it no longer sounded like John was playing, and the piano was producing mysterious melodies from a different world, which Violet seemed to connect to. Like a nuclear explosion, I could no longer contain the energy and screamed my lungs out. My family screamed with me. Two hours into the prayer, I was exhausted beyond description; I felt close to fainting, but still, I pushed through. I fell into the circle and then felt it. My stomach muscles began contracting in painful spasms. My screams were mingled with bleating, and the darkness felt pierced. With every contraction and scream, the darkness opened further. Every wave of sound from our mouths felt like I was overcoming some darkness within and around me. I felt an indescribable release, just as everyone collapsed, and the piano and drums returned to normal. This was travail. I experienced it, and something new was born inside me. I suddenly thought of John. I felt a deep longing to know him, to connect with him like I never had before, as each drumbeat coincided with my heartbeat. We all knew that tonight we fought the good fight and pierced the darkness. Slowly, I returned to my individual self, but not in the same way. I don’t know what, but something was different.

The church doors opened, and we went outside. The tap water in my bottle was the most delightful liquid I had ever wanted to drink, and the cold breeze felt like it was gently caressing my skin. Heinrich’s whole shirt was dripping wet. My shirt had a large dark V from my neck down to my navel. We were all exhausted but joyful. Depression, fear, anxiety, and hate all seemed to have vanished. As if piercing that darkness had freed us, even momentarily, from the darkness in our souls. Even my desires for the abominable had disappeared.

Prayer meetings were not always this intense, but I began experiencing them this way more frequently. Every meeting was unique, a potential place to receive a new spiritual gift. As I grew in knowledge, I unlocked more potential to grow in Spirit. As I grew in Spirit, I discovered more knowledge. I began noticing the patterns of the Message everywhere. Verses became alive and meaningful. I didn’t just read verses; I lived and felt them through prayer and service. Verses like, “The deep calls out to the deep,” and “The Bridegroom calling to His Bride.” By now, my life was as sanctified as I could make it.

My music was all about Jesus, and I loved it. I was in church on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and twice on Sundays. On some Tuesdays, I would visit the hospital with brothers and sisters to pray for and with the sick and lost. Every other Saturday, I fundraised for our church building by selling donated clothing, baking pancakes and banana bread, or selling boerewors rolls at sports days. It was not just my mind and heart that experienced transformation, but my whole body. For the first time in my life, I was no longer fat. I was thin and full of energy. I actually liked myself when I looked in the mirror. My pornography addiction was gone, and even though lust was always a lurking temptation, I kept it at bay with regular fasting and immersing myself in teachings and worship music. All this while studying engineering. God does miracles, at a minimum seen when I passed my modules, even though my studies were far less important than the Message. My passion for Jesus, being part of the Bride, and growing in Word and Spirit overflowed, and I began drawing new people into the church with me. I was living a supernatural life. The book I read, The Shack, was not merely a novel to me; it was speaking the truth hidden in a fictional story. A God-centered life was now my reality. Often, through consultation with Pastor Reuben, God was now part and parcel of every decision, or so I thought.
