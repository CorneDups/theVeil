Part 5: Pastor—Strengthen the Faith of His Sheep

My final year of engineering had arrived, just as John and Heinrich were entering their final year of education. The three of us—single brothers—often spent time together, helping out others in the church. There were a few single women in the congregation as well, and since the church was strongly family-oriented, there was always hope for new love.

John and Mary had begun a relationship, and after a few private consultations with Pastor Reuben, Heinrich started dating Lea. Heinrich told me these sessions had helped him work through some personal struggles.

Now, I was the only single guy

So when Reuben asked if I would consider scheduling a consultation, I eagerly said yes.

Reuben was married to Violet, a woman born and raised in the church. She had two young daughters from a previous marriage—her first husband had left the church. I was told he had been a sinful man, unfit for the Message.

When I arrived at their home, Violet welcomed me with a warm smile. It stretched across her entire face, her eyes turning into small, gentle lines. She exuded peace. Like most people, she was taller than me. A small Pekingese dog barked excitedly at my feet as I stepped inside.

Their home was beautifully decorated—wooden furniture, antiques, but nothing ostentatious.

Reuben greeted me warmly and led me to his study.

I had never shared my deepest struggles with anyone before, so opening up was difficult.

At first, I danced around spiritual concepts, trying to evade discussing my sins directly. But Reuben encouraged me—he wanted me to bring my struggles into the light so we could pray for them and seek healing.

In that first session, I shakily admitted that I struggled with lust.

To my surprise, he responded with kindness. He reassured me that it was a common battle—one he himself had overcome with God’s help. His compassion encouraged me.

For the first time, I felt like I had someone I could trust with the darkness inside me.

Each time I visited, I revealed a little more of myself.

I told him about my father’s alcoholism and how it had eroded my childhood and my understanding of fatherhood. I told him how I had always felt different, how I had struggled to form deep friendships with other men. I shared my dreams and asked what they might mean.

But one week, after being asked too many times when I would find a "nice girl," I finally opened up more than ever before.

Reuben could see I was holding something back. He gently prodded, reassuring me that his study was a safe space.

I hesitated, then began a long, shaky confession.

I told him how I had never shared this with anyone. How it had haunted me for as long as I could remember. How, as a six-year-old boy, the very thought had filled me with terror.

Then, I said it.

I don’t feel any attraction toward girls. I feel attracted to guys.

I had tried to change it, over and over. But I couldn’t. It felt hardwired, unchosen.

The moment I spoke the words, it felt as if a bottle, sealed for twenty years, had finally burst open.

Reuben was the first person I had ever told.

I shared how this had led to my depression in my first year at the men’s hostel, the reason I had left.

He asked if I had ever acted on these feelings.

I told him no.

He didn’t respond with condemnation, only compassion.

Then he said something I had never heard before.

Many men who struggle with homosexuality, he explained, have a high calling in the Bride. The feminine and the masculine, the Spirit and the Word, the Fire and the Ice—these forces were almost equal inside me, mixing up my feelings.

More importantly, he said, my desire for the Bridegroom was so strong that I had confused it with attraction to men.

For the first time, my struggle seemed to have meaning, perhaps even divine purpose.

Reuben assured me that he did not believe I was truly gay. He told me that if I stayed faithful to the Message, one day I would wake up and these desires would be gone.

I wanted so desperately for that to be true.

I doubted it—but I wanted it to be true.

Little did I know that it would happen, just not in the way either of us expected.

Reuben and I grew closer.

We spoke regularly over BBM and WhatsApp. We saw each other at services, sharing life and faith.

I was never sexually attracted to Reuben or Heinrich, or most of the men in the church. That was one of the reasons I loved being there. I felt part of a brotherhood, free from unwanted desire.

With one exception.

John.

Reuben’s youngest brother.

By now, my mind went haywire whenever John was physically close to me.

I struggled to think clearly. I froze up or acted strangely around him.

Looking back, it made perfect sense. My mind had repressed my sexuality so deeply that I hadn’t recognized it before.

Now, it was undeniable.

I kept no secrets from Reuben.

He was my sin-eater—the one person I confessed everything to. Every past and present sin, no matter how small, I shared with him.

So when I admitted my attraction to John, his response was immediate:

Do not tell John. It would upset him.

Lovingly, Reuben encouraged me.

He told me he believed I was hungering for male friendship.

Maybe, he suggested, true male bonding with John would heal my attraction to him.

I loved hearing that.

It gave me permission to be closer to John, to spend more time with him.

Reuben had unknowingly planted the seed of chaos.

But isn’t it strange?

Even in the most rigid cultures, the human heart finds a way to pursue love.

At this time, I lived near John’s hostel, so I often picked him up on my way to church and dropped him off afterward.

I was still growing in the Word and the Spirit, but now, I also wanted to grow this friendship.

So, I started praying for John.

Every ride we shared, I learned more about him—his childhood, his love for dogs and wolves, the pain of losing a close friend in a freak car accident.

He also hinted at a personal battle he had fought before joining the church, something that had required intense fasting and prayer.

But he never told me what it was.

Extroverts talk a lot, but sometimes their words are a shield, a distraction to keep others from looking deeper.

I wanted to see beneath the surface.

While I was slowly getting to know John, I was also bringing new people into the church.

Yollande, my heart friend, left her life behind in Vanderbijlpark to seek a deeper relationship with Jesus.

Gerhard, my childhood friend, joined after losing his grandfather, one of the closest people in his life.

Wiaan, my engineering classmate, had just lost his father to disease. I comforted him with words from the Message.

Sarah, another engineering friend, gave up her beauty to join the church.

Theresa, whom I had walked a long road with, joined—but later left again.

At one point, they called me the Evangelist for the Message.

Reuben had the same effect.

We both authentically believed in what we were teaching.

We had experienced God in ways most people could only dream of.

But looking back now, I wonder,

Each person I brought in had been at a pivotal, vulnerable point in their life.

Just like I had been.

When Heinrich came to my room that night for coffee, I was in a pit of despair.

I had just read Romans, where homosexuality is condemned.

I believed I was an abomination in God’s eyes.

And if God didn’t love me, who could?

But the Message changed that.

It gave my struggle meaning.

My sexuality wasn’t a curse—it was proof that I had been called higher.
