Part 6: Trials and Tribulations

A part of me believed that if I could just get close enough to John—build a strong male bond with him, my sexuality would untwist, and I would wake up heterosexual.

Another part of me knew that every moment we spent together, every piece of life we shared, only deepened my attraction to him.

But at this stage of my life, I was a master of repression.

I pushed that realization deep into the shadows, refusing to acknowledge it.

Instead, I told myself lies about why I should spend time with John.

And so, I buried myself further in the Word (notes), consuming them with relentless hunger. I pushed myself further into the spiritual experiences.

I think, deep down, I wanted to prove—to God, to myself—that my intentions with John were pure.

If I just worked harder, if I just performed more, I would be free.

It was not in vain—I did learn a lot. But the seed of chaos had begun to germinate.

The duality in my mind was taking hold.

Many evenings, I would make a list and pray for people.

I would ask God to give me a Word, a Bible verse—something I could share with them, something to guide my prayers.

Sometimes, I simply felt an urge to pray for someone without knowing why.

John was never far from that list.

One evening, I prayed fervently for him and felt that God had given me a verse.

By now, John and I had developed a stronger friendship.

We would often spend hours just sitting in my new (old) car—a 2005 white Citi Golf—parked outside his hostel, talking.

We explored questions, stories, sermons, and ideas about life.

I told myself I was meant to help John grow in the Message, that he struggled to make it his own.

That night, I handed him a printout of Psalm 27, the verse I had received in prayer.

He read it, then looked up at me, eyes filled with tears.

"You have special gifts," he said. "You should embrace them more."

Then he hugged me.

Thank you, brother. You don’t know what this means to me.

I felt so good.

I told myself this was the moment.

The brotherly love I had shown had helped John connect with God.

On my way home, I was on cloud nine.

And yet—my attraction to him was not diminishing.

In the weeks that followed, I started listening to sermons not for my growth, but for John's.

Every lesson, every Word, I tried to apply to him.

Without realizing it, I was developing an obsession unlike anything I had ever experienced before.

And it was consuming me.

The only place I found freedom from it was in intense prayer.

So I pushed myself beyond the limits I knew.

And that was when people started noticing another change in me.

After one of our combined prayer meetings with a sister church, an elder pulled me aside.

"You have a gift," he said. "You should become a prayer warrior."

I embraced this new goal with everything in me.

Maybe if I reached a certain level as a prayer warrior, I could pray through my obsession with John.

Performance and reward.

No matter how hard I worked, though, my obsession only grew worse.

By now, if there was even a chance John would be somewhere, I wanted to be there too.

I would spend hours doing things I hated just for the chance to spend a few minutes near him.

I even played touch rugby—a game I was terrible at—just to be close to him.

Reuben agreed that maybe I should distance myself from John.

I fully supported the idea—logically.

But in my heart, it felt like a dagger.

Then, Mary broke up with John.

He was heartbroken, and all I wanted to do was be there for him.

But I had to perform.

I had to prove that my will and faith were strong enough to resist.

And then, something happened that I cannot fully describe.

A darkness I had never known before came over me.

It felt as if I had been thrown into a deep hole where no light could reach.

My thoughts no longer felt like my own.

No matter how hard I tried, everything in my mind was connected to John.

Yet, I had to avoid him.

I had to distance myself.

My mind and heart were at war.

And the war was devouring me.

What made it worse was that I suffered in silence.

Reuben—my pastor, the only one who knew my secret—had a congregation to tend to.

He couldn’t always be there.

At some point, something inside me imploded.

It felt as if my mind had fractured.

I struggled to concentrate.

Yet, I continued my church activities.

Only my studies suffered.

But I was an expert at hiding pain.

For a long time, I had believed my ability to suppress my struggles was a sign of strength.

Now, I see it for what it was.

Weakness.

Near the end of my fourth year, I failed a module.

My first rewrite.

I believe now that it was linked to my implosion.

The seed of chaos had begun to break through the soil.

Reuben suggested I write a letter to the Word Witness—Reverend Hicks.

She could offer guidance.

Many people wrote to her for direction in their lives.

It wasn’t required, but it was highly encouraged.

And when guidance did come, it was revered.

It would travel from Rev Hicks → Rev Hayden → Reuben → Me.

Reuben was passionate about the Message.

He wanted to be as close to the source as possible.

I felt the same.

Writing to Hicks made me feel connected to something greater.

So, I poured my heart into that letter.

I asked about my desires.

About my future.

And then, I waited.

Meanwhile, I had a decision to make.

I could either move to Johannesburg to begin working and pay off my bursary debt...

Or I could apply for a master’s degree and stay in Potchefstroom for two more years.

I prayed. I cried. I interceded.

But I never heard an answer from God.

And no response came from the Witness, either.

When the deadline came, I made my choice.

I stayed.

I told myself it was because I wanted to be close to the Message.

But deep down, I knew the truth.

I wanted to be close to John.

Master’s studies were different.

The rigid structure of my undergrad was gone.

Suddenly, I had time.

Two brothers who had completed their master’s gave me tips, but still—the freedom was overwhelming.

More time meant more church, more notes, more prayer.

I consumed sermons faster than ever.

For John’s birthday, I bought him a ticket to a Jesus Culture concert.

On the surface, it was a kind gesture.

But beneath it?

A strategy.

A way to spend more time with him.

The year was 2012.

Conspiracy theories swirled about the world’s end.

The Mayan calendar had predicted it—or so people claimed.

Of course, we didn’t watch the blockbuster movie about it—it wasn’t sanctified.

But in our world, the end was always near.

We believed the Rapture could happen at any moment.

Sometimes, if we couldn’t reach someone from church, we’d joke that the Rapture had come and we’d been left behind.

But beneath the laughter was fear.

Rev Hicks warned us often: If we turn our backs on the Message, we will be thrown into outer darkness.

A place of eternal torment, where we would see what we had missed, but never reach it.

I wasn’t afraid of demons.

I wasn’t afraid of angels.

I was afraid of not making it.

So, yes, I was scared. Not scared of any of the strange sounds or demonstrations, nor demons or angels. I was scared of not making it into the Bride and being cast into outer darkness. It made decisions easier. Play games that could lead to outer darkness, or pray. Obviously, I chose to pray. Give up my heart's desires or indulge in them until outer darkness came? Obviously, my heart's needs were nothing compared to hell. I began noticing that underneath all my seeming love and compassion, there was a spirit of performance, trying to earn my way up the Tabernacle, as outer darkness was constantly snapping at my heels. The awareness was so faint that I never dwelled on it, but it was always there.

In February, we received the latest notes from Rev Hicks. One of the sermons caught my attention: The Third Eye. I had always been drawn to mystical theories but mostly stayed away, believing they were from the evil one. But now, the Message was sanctified and from God, so this teaching couldn’t possibly be from the evil one. I got home and started studying the two-part sermon with great intensity. I made it my constant prayer to receive the Third Eye she had taught about. At every prayer meeting, I would practice what she taught on how to receive this gift.

One night, I had a disturbing dream. In the dream, I saw Rev Hicks, which wasn’t uncommon for me at this stage, but it was only her head, and it was dark blue, as if she were already dead. From her head, long black wires shot out and into the people around her. I shared the dream with Reuben, who agreed it was strange and suggested it might reference the dark side of the church. This was the first time I had heard about the ‘dark’ side of the church. Reuben explained that these were people within the Message who were actively working against Hicks. That was all he shared, and my imagination was left to ponder it.
