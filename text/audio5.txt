Part 7: Going Deeper, Into the Inner Cave

It’s 05:30. The sun is beginning to rise, and I am parked outside John and Heinrich’s place.

Heinrich was unable to join us for the Jesus Culture event and had traded his ticket with Esther.

Esther had endured incredibly painful life experiences, yet every tragic story in her past had been met with miraculous interventions from God. She was a gifted pianist, studying forensic accounting sciences, and she carried herself with an unshakable faith.

Esther was special to me. She lived in reckless abandonment to God.

I picked her up from the hostel and switched places, so John could drive.

We arrived early, and thank goodness—we barely secured parking before tens of thousands of people flooded in, eager to worship with Jesus Culture.

The event was a full-day experience, focused on walking in the Spirit and reaching out to others.

In the morning, something peculiar happened.

During a tea break, a couple behind us pulled me aside.

The woman looked at me intently.

"I feel a lion inside you," she said.

I froze.

I loved lions.

It was something Reuben and I shared, and the roaring lion had always been a symbol of Jesus to me.

But these strangers couldn't have known that.

Not without some divine insight.

That evening was even stranger.

During worship, one of the church leaders shared a vision he had received.

"I saw a great, golden head," he said. "From this head, wires extended into people’s heads. Once the wires connected, the golden head controlled them, and they couldn’t break free."

Chills ran down my spine.

This was almost identical to the dream I had about Reverend Hicks.

Had God sent me that dream to make this connection?

No… He wouldn’t… It must mean something else.

The climax of the evening came when the Jesus Culture worship team invited us to accept a spiritual burning coal—a symbolic act of embracing a greater call to spread God's love and light.

Between the three of us, I was the only one who stood up to accept it.

We left just before the final song to avoid the rush of traffic.

It was already past 22:00, and the long drive back loomed ahead.

John took the wheel again while Esther dozed off in exhaustion.

Somewhere along the road, John and I started talking about desire.

He told me something that Violet had once shared with him:

"The unfulfilled desires of our hearts are the ones that God intends to fulfil—His way, in His time."

My breath caught.

John had no idea how much he was my unfulfilled desire.

Hearing those words from his lips felt like God Himself was telling me, I will fulfil this desire… but it must be Me, not John.

A few weeks earlier, as a Christmas gift, my father had bought me Walking with God by John Eldredge.

I started reading it, and it captivated me.

The book was a year-long chronicle of Eldredge’s conversations with God, revealing that God speaks all the time—we just have to learn how to listen.

I devoured every page.

I yearned for that kind of intimacy with God, where He would be my closest Friend, Brother, and Partner throughout life.

One month later, the Easter Conference arrived again.

I was excited—not just to learn from Rev. Hayden, but to spend time with John.

Heinrich, John, and I decided to arrive a day early to help with the arrangements.

This time, instead of tents, we booked a condo—a single room with eight bunk beds.

On the drive there, my passenger was Rick, an older man with a complicated history.

Years ago, he had been in the Message alongside Reuben’s father-in-law, Oom Jason.

Jason often told us that John, Heinrich, and I reminded him of his youth—back when he and Rick were inseparable.

But Rick had left the Message for a long time.

There was an air of secrecy around his past.

Reuben sometimes spoke of him in a dismissive, almost condescending way, though he never revealed details.

John once told me they had found worrying items when helping Rick move—but he wouldn’t elaborate.

So my imagination filled in the blanks.

Rick was kind and grateful, but he carried an air of someone without a choice to be any other way.

His complexion was rough, his face dark red—lungs weakened from years of smoking.

His church clothes didn’t fit well.

Maybe they had been gifted to him.

Maybe they had just gathered dust for too many years.

When we arrived, we unpacked.

I chose the lower bunk in the corner, while John and Heinrich took the top bunks beside me.

After Heinrich climbed up and down a few times, he decided that a giant moving up and down a flimsy metal frame might end badly.

So he took the lower bunk instead.

Almost without thinking, being the shortest, I switched into Heinrich’s old place.

Now, my bunk was directly above Heinrich, and John’s was beside me.

Our heads were barely 20 centimetres apart.

That first night, exhaustion settled over the room.

I tried to sleep.

But this was the first time John and I had ever shared a room.

My hormones were raging.

I couldn’t turn them off.

Eventually, exhaustion took over.

The beds were uncomfortable.

Men snored.

At some point in the middle of the night, I woke up.

I could hear John’s breathing.

The soft rhythm of inhale… exhale…

The unconscious motor functions that sustain us, even when we are unaware.

I could reach out and touch him, and he wouldn’t know.

But that would be wrong.

Yet, once that thought was planted, it grew.

Fast.

Furious.

I told myself I just wanted to pray over him.

So, I reached out and touched his shoulder.

His breathing changed slightly.

Then it returned to normal.

So I prayed.

But when it was time to take my hand away—

I didn’t.

The repressed monster inside me had awakened.

I wanted John.

And here he was.

Next to me.

Asleep.

But I managed to stop myself.

Barely.

I fell asleep with my hand still resting on his shoulder.

Nothing perverse happened that night.

But it was only the first of three nights.

The next day, I was exhausted.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the night before.

My mind and heart felt split in two.

My first true love—Jesus.

My first human love—John.

The war between them was tearing me apart.

That night, I tried to resist.

But I failed.

I told myself I just wanted to be near him.

But I went further.

I wish I could tell you I stopped.

That my love for Jesus was stronger.

But that would be a lie.

Though nothing sexual physically happened—not even masturbation,

In my mind, the evil thoughts were celebrating.

I had crossed a line.

I had touched John without his consent.

Again.

And again.

I was ashamed.

I was disgusted.

But no amount of self-hatred could erase my desire for him.

After three days of this, my mind felt like it was tearing apart.

John never seemed to suspect anything.

But I knew.

And God knew.

A secret.

One I could never confess,

Especially not to Reuben.

John’s oldest, most protective brother.

On my way home after the conference, I couldn’t stop thinking about those nights. They gnawed at my every thought, constantly occupying my mind. As I drove back with Rick beside me, I tried to get him to tell me—if a sin was big enough, could it take me out of the Message? I started thinking that maybe something similar had happened to him, causing him to leave. Eerily, it felt as though Rick’s past was going to become my future because of this sin. The obsession I had the previous year was nothing compared to this. It was like an earworm, but mixed with unspoken desires and no outlet. The pressure was building. My heart was full of atrocious thoughts and imaginations, things that no one should ever know about. To make matters worse, I was starting to struggle with sleep. I had never struggled with sleep before. My mind and heart tried to find someone or something to blame for this, some spiritual reason why, but now I think it was all just a way to deceive myself and avoid the truth. It was my fault, and it was wrong. If I could, I would have told John that. I should never have opened this Pandora’s box, which reduced John to a piece of clay that I wanted to mold into my desires. If he ever picks up this book, I want him to know how terribly wrong this was of me, and I accept his rejection—I deserved more than that. I felt like the biggest sinner who ever lived, and imprisonment was what I deserved. I never faced it—the fear was just too great. In selfish self-defense and deceit, I started imagining that Rev Hayden had something to do with why I couldn’t stop myself from touching John. The seed of chaos began to sprout. This was also my last conference, and over the next few months, I would experience many "lasts," only realizing so after the moment had passed.

As before, I used the formula of converting anxiety into prayer meeting material. Still praying for gifts, even though I felt constantly dirty. No matter how much I repented, I still wanted John, so my repentance felt fake, as my heart did not agree. I started sketching to keep my mind off my terrible actions. I told Reuben that I had done something very shameful, something I couldn’t share with him, and even though he asked for more details, I kept denying it, so he let it go. The split in my mind from that conference still lingered, and it felt like the tear was slowly widening. John started seeing a new girlfriend, and the three of us went out for coffee. Seemingly out of the blue, John asked me if I knew that I touched people when I sleep. I turned ice cold, but I tried to pretend that I was unaware and embarrassed about it. I quickly changed the subject as I felt that tear in my mind grow a few inches larger. Urgently, I wanted to consult with Reuben, but he and the others were preparing for their month-long trip to America to visit the mother church where Rev Hicks preaches. He didn’t have time to talk, so I did what I always did: I repressed all the shame and guilt further. Because so many of the church members were going, we needed someone on the guitar, as a singer, worship leader, and pianist. I had been in a choir for more than seven years during school, and I loved singing. So, I auditioned and got the role of temporary singer. I was excited about this because I had always wanted to sing with the worship team, but I had always been too shy to express this desire. We practiced before every service, and I was getting better. At the same time, when I closed my eyes, I began to see my body full of closed eyes. As these bodily eyes began to open, my ability to draw and create sketches improved. Every sketch seemed to teach me something about reality and my journey. I also started drawing some of the mystical visions I began having, like the sword of fire and ice, the heart of opening eyes, and the horse of faith. After a third of the church left for America, in my mind, more of these bodily eyes started opening. At every worship service, I learned more about leading worship as another eye would open.

One evening, when I arrived to start practice, Oom Jason was late, and I confronted him about it. Later, I learned that this was already seen as outside of my character. I began leading worship regularly and helping choose the songs and flow of the service. Sometimes I would help lead the prayer meeting in Reuben’s absence. Yollande and I shared a lot during this time. She began experiencing more and more visions, which were strange for her because she had always been skeptical of visions, especially her own. In one of these visions, we were sitting in my car and talking. Suddenly, Leviathan appeared between us, turned his head to look at me, and then slithered away into the church. We couldn’t imagine what it meant at the time. I poured my heart into the role of worship and prayer leader. On Wednesday, 18th July 2012, we sang the song from Jesus Culture, “Break Every Chain,” and many of us had a strong experience with the Spirit, including Yollande. That night was also my last night as a worship leader, since the flight back from America landed that evening. As I said goodbye that evening, greeting John last, I felt like I was saying more than just a normal goodbye. When I got home, I felt empty. I was tired of fighting these desires. I wanted it to stop. I wanted that elusive peace and hope back. I knelt in front of my bed and kept praying, praying that God would take away my heart’s desires or just take away my heart completely. I didn’t want this broken thing anymore. I couldn’t change the gender I was attracted to, no matter how hard I tried, how high I grew, or whatever gift I received. A part of me didn’t want to wake up again. I don’t remember climbing into bed; I just remember such overwhelming sadness and darkness flooding my whole being…
