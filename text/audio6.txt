Part 8: The Dragon Awakes

When I woke up on Thursday, the 19th of July 2012, my sexual attraction to John was gone.

It felt as if Reuben’s vision for me had finally come true.

At the same time, I began to hear a faint voice whenever I thought about someone or something.

Almost like a narrator, whispering descriptions, offering insight into whatever I observed.

When I closed my eyes, I saw all the eyes on my body were open.

I immediately called Reuben.

“I don’t feel attracted to John anymore,” I told him, “but… I also hear voices.”

He warned me not to listen to them and said he would make time to see me.

That whole day at the office, the narrator’s voice followed me.

Whenever I spoke to someone, it would tell me things about them—suggest what I should say or ask.

And when I followed its prompts?

They were correct.

I was astonished.

It felt like mind reading, as if I was receiving hidden knowledge about people without them ever speaking a word.

That evening, when I went to bed, I fell into a trance-like state.

I was lying in my bed, but my mind was traveling to places far away.

As if I existed in two places at once.

It happened again and again throughout the night.

On Friday, I was exhausted.

I hadn’t slept well.

But that night’s prayer meeting amplified everything.

In the middle of it, I felt like I was no longer just one with the congregation,

I was watching celestial battles unfold.

Magnificent beings.

Forces at war.

That evening, I drove home to Parys to see my friends.

And I freaked them out.

At one point, I accidentally touched my oldest friend’s knee, and he jerked back as if shocked by electricity.

I started knowing things about their pasts.

I brought up details I had never been told.

It felt revelatory to me.

But to them?

It was disturbing.

That night, when I couldn’t sleep again, I felt God telling me to place four angels in the four corners of my room to protect my body while I slept.

So I did.

And for the first time in days,

It worked.

By Saturday, something new emerged.

I felt the invisible energy flow between people.

Every interaction—every conversation—was an exchange of energy.

We transmit, store, release, redirect, and transform the energy we receive.

I also felt as if I could read the thoughts and emotions of animals, communicating with them through the same unseen medium.

That afternoon, I took a long walk with my younger sister, who was nearly ten years old.

I shared some of my strange ideas with her, believing these gifts were too much for most people.

Which could only mean one thing,

God was going to call me away soon.

At the end of our walk, I told her:

"Don’t be afraid if something happens to me. God will take care of you, even if I’m not here anymore."

She started crying.

She didn’t want me to go anywhere.

The more I tried to reassure her that God would take care of her, the worse it became.

In her mind, if I did leave…

It would be God’s fault.

That night, I felt a new sense of urgency.

I was going to fight the Antichrist and his dragon.

Again, I placed four angels in the corners of my room before bed.

But my mind found no rest.

The Final Sunday

Sunday morning, I drove back to church.

As I was leaving Parys, I saw something strange,

I saw my own car driving past me…

Leaving Potch.

I was in the driver’s seat.

Yollande was sitting beside me.

But I ignored it.

That day would be my last two services at the church.

But I didn’t know that yet.

I desperately needed to talk to Reuben.

If anyone understood what was happening to me, it was him.

But we couldn’t talk before the service.

When I entered the church building, a calmness washed over me.

But multiple strange things happened that morning.

I touched a brother’s ankle, and suddenly saw him as a small boy. I saw his first experience with the Holy Spirit, but also a painful event mingled with it.

I touched the church walls, and they spoke to me. They felt sad. Someone in the church is doing things they shouldn’t be doing.

Every hand I touched, I sensed more than ever before.

By the end of the service, my senses were overwhelmed.

I waited outside for Reuben, covering my ears, rocking slowly.

Violet approached me.

"What’s wrong? Can I help?"

I shook my head.

"I need to talk to Reuben. You won’t understand."

But she pressed.

So I told her:

"You’re going to twist my words."

In my mind, I was sitting on the edge of a shore, on an island in the middle of the sea of forgetfulness.

And someone ancient was calling me into the ocean.

When Reuben finally came out, Violet spoke first.

But she twisted my words.

I corrected her, loudly.

That was prideful.

And disrespectful.

Reuben scolded me.

I told him, "Everything is watching me and speaking to me, and I don’t know what to do."

His face darkened.

He confirmed it.

And yet…

When I begged him for guidance, he dismissed me.

"We already have an appointment," he said.

They had to leave.

I was disappointed, but I told myself:

This is just a postponement… right?

That evening service, the church walls seemed to speak even more, and I began following the teachings of the other world. I realized that, while I was at the service, these two worlds would coincide in the same space. Though they appeared very different, they were connected in ways I couldn’t fully understand. That night, I felt the love of God pour over every person I saw—and over me. His love felt tangible, like an invisible, thick blanket wrapped around each person. When I looked at each brother or sister, I felt a deep compassion, uniquely tailored for each. Rick’s blue eyes were shining with God’s love. The music felt like it represented the Body of Christ. The singers were the voice, the guitarists were the strings between the heart and mind, the piano was the mind, but the drums were the heart of God. Together, playing as one, we were the canvas of the Body, moving excitedly as He wanted us to move. When I got home, I felt like the biggest key to obtaining this experience was three words: "God is love." Those three words held more meaning than every book ever written.

Sunday evening, as I tried to sleep, my mind began to wander further than ever before. I saw Rev Hicks. I found her in a strange, barren place full of darkness. She gave me a look and told me that I possessed the same gift she had. She explained that she had used this gift to delve deep into the darkness to find the light. She said that she didn’t have long left on earth and that I could take her place—but not until she had left. She then showed me how she would navigate through darkness and find pieces of gold. The gold was what she shared with us in her sermons. So, I began following her example, mining the spiritual darkness within me.

On Monday morning, the narrator’s voice became prophetic. It didn’t feel like I had any control, as though this narrator was speaking through me to Reuben. Whenever I started writing a message to Reuben, it felt like something—or someone—was speaking to him through me. The prophetic voice began recalling the seven-day creation, saying that from the 19th to the 26th of July, I would undergo a creation process. This meant I was already five days into it, and it felt true. Every day, something new would emerge within me, separated from the rest, becoming a new ability. But then I wondered—what would happen on Thursday (26th July 2012) when it was all done? This was just one of the hundreds of messages, thoughts, and ideas I received, many of which I shared with Reuben. Even though I wrote them, I often forgot most of them immediately after. One of the few messages I do remember giving Reuben was that everything I was writing to him wasn’t just for the moment, but to be used by him later, not by me.

The visions began to grow darker, and I saw images of the end times’ tribulation period, ready to begin. This would start when the antichrist was awakened and found his beast. The call I heard was that my role was to identify the antichrist spirit in the mental realm and prevent it from succeeding before it entered the visible world. At the same time, Jesus said that the greatest love is for a man to lay down his life for his friends or brothers. So, because I wanted to live out the greatest form of love—especially for my brothers—I started preparing myself for death. After searching all through Monday night, on Tuesday morning, I believed I found where the antichrist spirit was hiding: Rev Hayden. I saw how he was using similar abilities of the mind, some of which I had, to search for and awaken the beast. I started thinking that the antichrist was manipulating the Message to lure in the beast because of the powerful spiritual knowledge they provided.

Then I felt the narrator tell me that, even though I was not the beast, I would be the decoy and appear to be it. I would need to lay down my life to save my brother—the brother who unknowingly harbored the spirit of the beast, John. That dark night of prayer at the conference, when my hands were on him, I felt like I had bound myself to John, and that’s why only I knew. Additionally, Hayden had to search through thousands of minds and places before he could reach John. And even if he did get close, with my newfound abilities, I would appear to be the answer to his quest and take John’s place. Thus, my sacrifice could save him from becoming the beast, circumventing the antichrist's plan with both Rev Hayden and John.

From Tuesday to Wednesday, I was constantly evading dark spiritual forces, as I felt the antichrist spirit had become aware of me. Like moths drawn to the light, the darkness was drawn to me. The calling’s intensity escalated, and I was still not sleeping. The next evening would be my last service at this church, but if I had known that beforehand, things might have turned out differently.

Part 9: Gifts from God or Darkness?

Wednesday arrived.

Six days had passed since the voices began, and by now, I was starting to navigate this strange reality.

I wasn’t just influencing the visible world—I was interacting with the invisible one as well.

Both required action.

Action required energy.

And energy was a limited resource, unless it came from God.

It felt like I was inside a spiritual speed train tunnel.

A one-way track, where I had to follow the Narrator’s instructions with perfect obedience.

Everything was time-sensitive.

Every action had urgency.

I was being moved at the speed of sound from a known place to a mysterious destination beyond my control.

That Wednesday evening, Reuben announced that instead of a sermon, we would have a prayer meeting.

Prayer meetings had changed for me.

Now, I saw the two worlds interact.

That night, we formed another prayer circle.

And as we prayed, I felt as though I was dancing and flowing between realms.

Moving in perfect sync with the sound of the Narrator.

Following His nudges.

Adjusting the spirit world as He instructed.

In my mind, the Narrator was God.

Who else could it be?

Who else could know these things?

At the climax of the prayer meeting, in the other world, I saw a massive lion’s head emerge from our prayer circle.

Then,

It turned to face Reuben.

And charged.

I opened my eyes.

And in the visible world?

Everyone fell down.

Exactly in the direction of the charge.

That was when I realized,

Before something happens in the visible world, it first happens in the spiritual one.

After everything calmed down, I saw something new—

A caged butterfly.

The Narrator told me:

"I will free the locked-up butterfly."

Then, He nudged me,

All of your brothers and sisters are caged.

"I will set them free."

I wanted them to be free.

But… weren’t we already free?

We were in the Message.

Everyone was there by choice.

We were walking closer to God than we ever could without the Message.

I consoled myself,

I just don’t understand yet.

Maybe it was some spiritual battle we were all facing together.

A Final Goodbye to John

After the service, I went to John.

"Can I speak with you for a moment?"

He agreed.

I pulled him aside.

I took a deep breath and said,

"I’m sorry for what I have done to you. I pray that one day, you will forgive me."

He frowned.

"What did you do?"

I shook my head.

"Your spirit knows."

That was the last time we would ever speak face to face.

But I didn’t know that.

I went back inside to wait for Reuben.

But this time,

He avoided me.

I told myself it was okay.

The prayer meeting had helped.

I was beginning to understand how to navigate this new reality.

But my comfort was short-lived.

That night, I still couldn’t sleep.

Thursday: The Chaos Flower Blooms

When Thursday morning came, seven days later,

I was exhausted.

The Chaos Flower was in full bloom.

I felt like Hayden was moving closer to Reuben.

He thought I was the beast.

And if he unlocked the beast, the End Times would begin.

I had to stop this.

I had to face the dragon.

I had to overcome it by God’s grace. Using these new supernatural gifts.

Before he could find me,

I was going to find him.

A Battle in Two Worlds

By now, my concentration was breaking down.

Every time I touched a person or an object, I received extra-sensory information.

And I felt as though a bright light was shining from my head,

Stretching vertically into the sky.

It was invisible to human eyes.

But I knew,

Angels and demons could see it.

People with sight could see it.

I needed a hoodie.

And gloves.

Anything to protect myself from the sensory overload.

That morning, I sat in a lecture hall, listening to a professor talk about organic chemistry.

But my mind was somewhere else.

In the spiritual realm, Rev. Hayden was hunting me.

He was sending others like me—people with similar gifts,

To find and stop me.

I had to evade them.

I had to get to him directly.

When I finally reached him, I struck.

I wielded the sword of fire and ice,

A weapon I had seen and sketched from the other world.

I injured one of the dragon’s heads.

But I didn’t kill it.

It retreated into the darkness.

For now.

The Antichrist spirit withdrew.

It needed time to recover.

The battle was not over.

Then, I saw it,

The church split in two.

Rev. Hayden was walking away, leading a large portion of the congregation with him.

Nobody could see what was happening inside him,

Because he had mastered the control of both light and dark, just like me.

But he was far better at it.

The Garden of the Mind

After the battle, I turned my attention to John.

I had to protect him.

I had to hide him from the dragon.

In the spiritual realm, I saw two mini-planets.

One was a city,

Full of structures, streets, and brick pavements.

The other was a garden,

Lush, green, and alive.

My mind was the city.

John’s mind was the garden.

Using every ounce of energy left, I wove them together.

I crossed into John’s mind.

There, I found him.

Dressed in gardening attire, complete with a straw hat.

His garden was beautiful,

Full of strange, exotic plants.

He was proud of them.

He showed me around.

But then, I saw two things that disturbed me.

First,

A massive rock, sculpted into the shape of a man’s head.

It constantly played drumming noises.

And it seemed like…

John was worshipping it.

So, together, we destroyed it.

I never stopped to consider my own hypocrisy.

John had been my idol for years.

And yet,

I never acknowledged it.

Then, he showed me a flower.

It looked like a sunflower.

But in the center,

Instead of seeds,

Was a giant yellow eye.

It stared at John.

And he froze.

Mesmerized.

Trapped.

I knew,

This was the way in.

This was how the dragon would unlock the beast in John.

I shook him free.

He reluctantly agreed to cut it down.

After that,

My work was done.

When I returned to the physical world, I was exhausted.

I dragged myself to my car,

Just to lay down and regain energy.

I had fought in two worlds at once.

And now,

I had nothing left.



Part 10: The Deepest Places

As I lay down, I felt something hold me.

Suddenly, I was fully immersed in the other world.

Jesus was standing beside me.

The Spirit moved between us, around us, within us.

Then Jesus turned to me and said,

"Follow Me to the Father."

I followed Him.

And before me stood the Father.

I couldn’t see His face,

But He was vast.

Larger than anything I could comprehend.

And He asked me one question:

"What do you want?"

Without hesitation, I answered,

"I want Your Perfect Will for my life."

In the church, we had been taught that God has multiple wills,

Like parallel universes, each laid out before us.

But His Perfect Will, That was the one path that led directly to His Heart.

The shortest route to His ultimate plan for me.

The Father responded,

"You will lose close relationships. It will be painful and full of sorrows."

"Are you sure this is what you want?"

A wave of anxiety rose inside me.

But then,

I looked at Jesus.

And peace flooded over me.

I asked, "Will Jesus still be with me?"

The Father laughed, cheerfully, warmly.

"Of course. He will never leave you. He is always with you."

So, I said,

"Yes. Then that is what I want."

The Father reached forward, pressing unknowable keys on a galaxy-sized keyboard, each key glowing with unfathomable colors.

Then, He spoke:

"It has started."

Surrendering Everything

At that moment,

Every idea, every hope, every desire I had ever held close,

Flashed before my mind.

Jesus turned to me.

And asked me to surrender them all.

It started with small things.

Memories.

Fleeting attachments.

Then

It grew.

He asked for my studies.

My reputation.

My friends.

My birth family.

Each surrender became harder than the last.

Then, it was time for my spiritual family.

Every brother and sister I had ever connected with,

One by one, I had to let go.

And finally,

John.

I had to give him up.

Forever.

I struggled.

More than ever before.

But finally,

I let go.

I opened my hands.

And released him.

Returning to the Physical World

As I awoke from the trance-like state, the world around me had changed.

Twilight had set in.

The car windows were fogged from the inside.

I had been in that state for hours.

The Narrator’s voice,

Usually ever-present, whispering constantly,

Now spoke only once.

One sentence, followed by silence.

"Collect your drawings. Go to Reuben’s house."

And so, I obeyed.
