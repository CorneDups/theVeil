Part 11: The Confrontation

As I pulled up to Reuben’s house, the Narrator’s voice spoke:

"Tell him the dragon has already been defeated."

I knocked on the door.

It was around 17:00, and at 18:00, they were set to begin something, I assumed it was a Bible study.

Reuben opened the door.

And as soon as I saw him,

I fell to my knees.

"I have slain the dragon," I declared.

Reuben freaked out.

"That’s not true! Get up!"

His voice was sharp, urgent.

He grabbed my drawings, his face twisting with disgust.

His eyes landed on one in particular,

A sketch of the Sword of Fire and Ice, the weapon I had used to wound the dragon.

"I drew these," I told him. "You can’t burn them."

But his anger ignited,

And without hesitation,

He burned them in front of me.

I pleaded,

"Please, help me."

But Reuben’s voice was cold.

"You don’t want help. You just want to destroy us."

In the other world, I saw Hayden panicking.

He was trying to find me—

Trying to use all his gifts to control those around him.

Trying to stop me from unraveling more of his plans.

Somehow,

I knew that Reuben and Violet were being controlled by something dark.

So I told him,

"It’s not me who wants to destroy you! It’s Reverend Hayden!"

"He’s going to tear the church in half!"

"If you don’t believe me then ask Hicks herself. She will know."

At this, Reuben exploded with fury.

Violet appeared, stepping in to "help deal with me."

She prayed the Blood of Jesus over me, over and over, like a chant.

Reuben, meanwhile, kept ordering me to leave.

I dropped to my knees.

"Please, just tell me what is happening!"

But they didn’t answer.

They just kept repeating:

"There are demons inside you."

Then they accused me of breaking things in their house,

That I was doing some kind of witchcraft.

But I couldn’t remember doing anything.

How could I?

For years, I had immersed myself in the Message’s teachings,

Not witchcraft.

Their little Pekingese dog waddled out, looking just as confused as I felt.

I reached for him, embracing his tiny, trembling body.

But Violet snatched him away.

Then she looked me straight in the eyes.

And asked,

"Do you know why we are treating you this way?"

I shook my head.

"No. Please, tell me why."

Violet took a breath.

And then,

With unwavering certainty, she said:

"Because we see Jesus inside of you."

Silence.

The moment the words left her lips, both their eyes widened.

Their faces twisted in panic.

Reuben snapped,

"Go inside!"

"He’s controlling your words!"

I was stunned.

I had no intention of controlling them.

But something was controlling them.

I could feel it.

It reeked of fear.

Reuben grabbed me, escorted me out through the front gate.

I collapsed next to my car,

And I sobbed.

These were the people I had trusted with my soul.

My spiritual leaders.

The ones I had believed would understand what was happening to me.

But they didn’t.

Or worse,

They refused to.

Suddenly, the front door burst open.

And I heard Violet,

Her voice sharp, cutting through the night,

"The Blood of Jesus over him!"

"The Blood of Jesus… The Blood of Jesus!"

Over.

And over.

And over.

Like a desperate chant.

I had a thought.

This is no demon.

If I were possessed,

Would I even be able to walk up to them?

To knock on their door?

The Blood of Jesus was stronger than any demon.

So,

Why was I still standing?

I pushed myself up.

I walked back to their front door.

And I knocked.

Again.

This time, when Reuben opened,

He was furious.

Without a word,

He threw me to the ground.

Then he grabbed my legs,

And dragged me out of their yard.

In the struggle, my clothes tore open.

I got up, dazed, shaking.

Tears filled my eyes as I turned to Reuben.

"Look at what you’ve done."

"My clothes are torn. Why? Why would you hurt me?"

At that moment,

It was like he snapped back into reality.

His face softened.

Guilt flooded his eyes.

And in a gentle voice, he said,

"I’m so sorry, Corne."

"Wait here, I’ll get you a new shirt."

He ran inside.

And the moment he was gone,

The Narrator whispered:

"It is done."

"You have seen what you needed to see."

"Now, go home."

When Reuben returned, holding a worn jersey, he asked,

"Are you okay?"

I looked at him.

I wanted to say something.

But instead, I just shook my head.

"No. Just leave me."

I turned away.

Walked to my car.

Pulled out my phone.

And messaged John.

Me: Where are you? Are you safe?

John: At a teacher’s meeting. I’m safe.

Relief washed over me.

Nothing had reached him.

Yet.

That meant my mission was complete.

I had been the decoy.

I had protected John.

And now,

I could perish.

A strange peace settled in the crater of my heart,

The aftermath of the Chaos Flower’s explosion.

As I drove away, I glanced in my rearview mirror.

I saw Yollande’s car pulling into Reuben’s driveway.

The Bible study was about to begin.

It was as if the last hour had been perfectly orchestrated,

By something far bigger than any of us.

Returning Home

I got home, feeling broken, uncertain, disturbed.

I blasted my music,

So loud that my landlord knocked.

But I couldn’t hear.

Wouldn’t listen.

Inside me, I felt the presence of a tiny, ancient child.

Fragile.

Hungry.

Lost.

So I picked up my Bible,

And started reading.

Trying to feed him.

Trying to make him grow.

I fell asleep, curled up in a ball.

And when I woke up the next morning,

The Narrator’s voice spoke one last command:

"Now, go out. Look for,

And ONLY follow,

LOVE."
