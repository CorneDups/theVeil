Part 12: The Long Road Back

I knocked on my landlord’s door, and they helped me.

Their care was so overpowering, so genuine.

They called my parents.

And as soon as my father heard, he immediately drove from Parys to get me.

Physically, I looked fine.

But when I spoke,

My father was horrified.

To me, everything I said was clear.

But to them

My words were chaotic, strange, and made no sense.

He took me to a GP, who found nothing wrong physically

But recommended I go to a psychiatric facility.

Potchefstroom had the best facilities

But it was outside our ideal options.

So, we chose Vanderbijlpark instead.

Coincidentally, this was the same hospital where Yollande’s mother worked.

A Strange Encounter with a Pastor

Before we left Parys, I met with Rinus, the local AGS pastor.

I shared my strange thoughts

And for the first time, it felt like someone could follow my world.

He didn’t flinch.

Didn’t waver.

His confidence in Jesus, his peace, and his love

It felt supernatural.

Every time I escalated, he stayed with me.

Every time I pushed, he remained steady.

Until

It felt like we were inside a dimensional bubble.

Like our spirits were speaking in a different realm

While our bodies remained on Earth, exchanging words.

His eyes shone with light.

His face glowed with warmth.

His whole body seemed golden-tinted.

Suddenly, I felt my arms rise into the air

Without my control.

I covered my forehead, because I could feel something

An eye had opened there.

An eye that would not close.

He asked me

"Who are you?"

The child inside me wanted to answer with some ancient name

But I said

"Corné."

Then he asked

"How old are you?"

The child inside me wanted to say

"Hundreds of years old."

But instead, I said

"Almost 23."

It felt like I wasn’t speaking as myself anymore

But as something ancient inside me.

The Breaking of the Soul Tie

I started experiencing blackouts.

I thought they were just moments of exhaustion

But later, I realized

There were times I couldn’t remember at all.

Sometimes, it felt like the child inside me was switching places with me

To protect me.

Then my mother told me something that shocked me

She said I had tried to exorcize the AGS pastor.

But I had no memory of it.

I only remembered

Falling asleep.

The last thing Rinus did

Was break the soul tie between me and John.

As soon as he did

I saw something flash before my eyes.

Two family trees

Mine and John’s

Growing upward, stretching toward the heavens.

And at some point

They had joined unnaturally.

Like a blood covenant.

And then

The connection broke.

And I felt released.

Hospitalization and the Strange Passage of Time

The following weeks were terrible.

The Chaos Flower wilted away.

The "gifts" began to fade

Drowned out by strong medication and constant supervision.

I spent ten days in the hospital, under heavy sedation.

The psychiatrist told my parents

"You caught it just in time."

"If this had gone on much longer, it could have been permanent schizophrenia."

But my time in the hospital was strange.

Possibly due to the medication.

My female psychiatrist visited me daily.

I distinctly remember

That on one visit, she was heavily pregnant.

Then, on another visit

Her stomach was flat.

And there was a little girl beside her.

A toddler.

But that wasn’t possible.

I had only been there for ten days.

When I told my father, he laughed.

"She’s obviously not pregnant," he said.

"It’s just more of your strange thoughts."

But a few months later

She was pregnant.

And she gave birth to a little girl.

Another strange experience

Was when my grandfather visited me.

He told me that when he first walked into my hospital room,

I had clenched the blankets over my head

Even though it was the middle of a hot day.

Gently, he peeled them back.

And to his surprise, I sat straight up.

Then I asked him

"Grandpa, how did you get past the two giant lions guarding my bed?"

He just laughed.

For weeks, he kept visiting me.

Kept listening to my thoughts.

Kept wrestling with my madness.

Trying to help me find clarity.

Seeking Spiritual Deliverance

After ten days, I was released

But I still had delusions.

So my parents, especially my father, called everywhere

Looking for a spiritual leader who specialized in exorcism.

The fear was that I was still possessed.

Or that I was still being controlled by demonic forces.

Everything I said

Everything I saw

Seemed dark.

Not from God.

What worried them the most

Was that I still wanted to return to the Message.

Finally, they found someone.

A medical doctor who also worked in deliverance ministry

Dr. Gerrie de Haas.

We drove six hours to his practice in Polokwane.

The night before my official consultation,

He invited us to his church.

Me, my mother, and my brother.

Even though I was still delusional,

I could feel that something was off.

The energy of the room

The way they spoke

Even my mother and brother noticed.

"They speak strangely," they said.

"It’s full of chaos. It makes no sense."

Just like they had described me.

The Prophetic Words of Dr. Gerrie

Then Dr. Gerrie came to me.

And something strange happened.

Both my hands and my brother’s hands started shaking.

Dr. Gerrie looked at us.

And simply said

"It’s because you both played games together."

He spoke deep truths about my mother and brother.

Things he couldn’t have known.

Then he turned to me.

Before I could even explain why we were there

He said:

"You took his place."

"It should have been the other one."

"But you decided to take his place."

And then

He reached toward my stomach.

And pulled something out.

In that moment

I felt the eternal child inside me leave.

I was free.

For the first time in months.

Dr. Gerrie’s assistant met with me after the service and told me that he saw I had strong spiritual gifts. He said that if I wanted to learn how to use them, I should contact him, as that journey would not be easy. The next day, during our consultation, I shared a little of my journey with him, after which he anointed my hands and prayed with me. He then looked me in the eyes as if seeing my future and said with exalted gladness, "You are going to be fine! You’re out of that place, and everything will be fine. You’ll see, in time." He also shared that I didn’t have demons inside me, but rather something ancient that I had inherited from my family tree, and that God would deal with it. On our way back to Parys, I reflected on how Dr. Gerrie had referenced my sacrificial trade with John and the broken link in my family tree that I thought I had seen when Rinus broke my soul tie with John. Both of these experiences I hadn’t shared with anyone yet. On the flip side, the typical scientific community would likely disagree with Dr. Gerrie, as they saw things differently.

I was initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which was later adjusted to manic depression before it was officially confirmed. You see, once bipolar is diagnosed, there is no cure, and you will remain on medication for the rest of your life. Bipolar is not just mania; it also involves psychosis when triggered. But what really caused all of this? Was my brain broken, just like my heart’s desires? Was it simply misfiring neurons? Could it have been the strange teachings of the church? Was this a collection of different spiritual gifts that people like Rev Hicks had access to? Or was it my obsession with John, my shame, and secrecy that caused a catatonic meltdown in my mind? Maybe it was everything. Reuben told everyone to stay away from me. My whole spiritual family rejected me. This rejection hurt more than words can say because, at that point, they felt closer to me than my birth family, from whom I had been disconnecting for years. So, I felt alone. Even Yollande was initially reluctant to see me, but being her wonderful, authentic self, she visited me in the hospital. They told the church I was in outer darkness, and that anyone who spoke to me would be pulled into outer darkness too—basically, I would take them to hell. So, I became the enemy. My deeply connected family tore me from their hearts and ignored every message I sent. Heinrich at least responded, saying maybe later we could see each other again, but that never happened. It took me some time, but I began to realize the value of my friendships outside the Message. Like my oldest friend, Hannes, in Parys, who made me laugh and sometimes helped me temporarily forget about all my problems. I was fortunate to still have them, because most people in the Message had very few relationships outside their spiritual family. Jana, a very close friend who was doing her Master's in Chemical Engineering with me, also stood by me. On the surface, she was a sweet, loving soul who always tried to create peaceful environments. Beneath the surface, she was extremely intelligent, focused, and passionate about upholding the truth, even when it was hard. I couldn’t go back to the church, but Jana fearlessly showed up there one Sunday morning, without telling me. She wanted to get an objective view, since my perspective was clouded by psychosis, mania, and depression. She noticed how Reuben would covertly make references to how I had fallen into outer darkness, and how everyone was afraid to talk to me. She could feel the fear and control between them. At the same time, she gently confronted me. After empathically listening to my delusions of mania, she shared that she felt there was deception in my experience. Her loving honesty and courage to offer me that insight set a new path in my mind. Maybe I was deceived. Maybe the narrator wasn’t always good, and I started becoming more honest with myself to uncover this deception.

I also visited Hendrik Venter, who helped many young people with troubled spiritual problems. Hendrik had years of experience dealing with satanism and helping people break free from it. As we spoke, verses would come to his mind—a gift of knowledge—and he would share them with me, which helped break so many false doctrines. I began to realize that I had traded my eternal security with Jesus for a performance-driven doctrine of gifts and shallow love. One of the powerful verses he gave me was John 10:27-29. But I also noticed that some of my experiences during the psychosis were shared by ex-satanists he had helped find freedom in Christ.

The scientific world explains mania as when you suffer delusions, often of great grandeur. Furthermore, extreme mania may trigger a psychosis, causing you to lose complete contact with reality, through hallucinations or catatonia. I agree that these definitions fit my experience—I did lose my mind. A psychotic mania is followed by severe depression, and that was also the case. The depression phase is often much longer than the mania phase, which is why it is so important to catch mania as soon as possible. I estimated my psychosis lasted 7 days before I received help. For the next 7 months, I was far from okay. I felt lost, having lost my dear brothers and sisters. I felt ashamed—everyone knew how I had gone crazy. I felt hopeless, as the reason I had been living—the Message—was an illusion. I gained so much weight, so quickly, that my body developed stretch marks on my thighs and stomach. I learned that this church was a cult, and that much of what Hicks taught, she had stolen from other authors, some of which even had occult origins. She shamelessly told the whole church how God spoke to her for hours while she wrote down His Words, only to find those words were identical to a different book! An arrogant copy-and-paste job of another human author’s work, yet she claimed it as her own divine revelation. If she could be dishonest about that, she was a fraud. She never confessed to this sin, and I believed she had lost her honest relationship with God. I think she did have one at the beginning, but power so easily corrupts the heart, and I related to that. I felt betrayed, but also as though I had betrayed all my friends whom I had led into that place. The psychologist recommended that I accept my sexuality instead of fighting against it, to which I initially disagreed. But after many conversations and much thinking, I realized that if I had to choose between being crazy or gay, being gay was probably the lesser evil. So, now I was a broken-brained, broken-hearted, fat, bald gay man who had been stupid enough to fall for a cult. This realization was more shameful and painful than I can describe, and I felt so alone as I struggled to believe Jesus was anywhere to be found. But I wasn’t alone—Yollande also left the Message, just as they had foretold. "Speak to Corné, and outer darkness will take you out."

Yollande and I felt as though we were in outer darkness, but again, we were not alone. Through interesting coincidences, Yollande was connected with Emeritus Prof. Henk Stoker, who specialized in the apocryphal field from the school of divinity at Potchefstroom. He was a middle-aged man with snowy hair. His nature was calm, but he became energized when he spoke about Jesus. He had a special love for those trapped in cults. He had spent many years working with Jehovah's Witnesses, facing their doctrines head-on and dismantling the false teachings. His book had helped many people break free from them. Now, he was with us, helping us understand what, where, how, and why the Message was a twisting of scripture.

This process was very helpful, even though my brain still felt broken, and I couldn’t really understand anything the way I wanted to. Yollande, with her brilliant mind and writing ability, began making notes on how this church had most of the attributes of cults: initial love bombing, followed by withdrawal when you didn’t commit to their beliefs; using disappointment or fear to keep you from leaving; special lingo and strange physical or mental techniques; the belief that only they held the ultimate truth, and that the conventional church wasn’t even aware of it. There were many confirmations, but the most iconic was that it was led by one extremely charismatic leader. One head controlled the whole system with power and fear. Rev Hicks' teachings were the only ones preached and taught. If I wanted to teach, it had to be strictly in line with the Message, or it wouldn’t be approved. Henk Stoker retaught us the Gospel of Love, showing that thinking we can grow in God through our works is a fallacy. His Love is what helps us grow, and it is a gift. His Love creates a safe space where I can confess my sins, and He is faithful to forgive me, releasing all shame and condemnation as He helps me grow through it. Yollande wrote it all down, and Henk Stoker saved it for potential future use. Little did we know what was about to unfold.

I felt so many things that I didn’t want to feel anymore. The extreme medication I was on ensured that I lived in a diminished state of dopamine and serotonin, which prevented another flare of mania. Despite many side effects, lower dopamine and serotonin meant that my drive and desire to achieve goals were greatly reduced. Initially, I truly wanted to find the truth. I received so much love and support from many people, even strangers, but I didn’t find the answers to my questions. I joined a small house church, led by beautiful-hearted leaders and believers. They sheltered me and showed me more of who God really is, even though my heart was too broken to embrace it completely. At one of these engagements, a friend shared a vision she had of me. She said I was standing outside a house. The front door was guarded by two lions, and inside, the Father was patiently waiting for me. He was waiting for me to come in so He could personally teach me, while I cried in His arms. She didn’t know my connection to lions, so the two guarding the entrance were a profoundly meaningful detail. But what does this mean? Was all that ‘spiritual’ growth in the cult meaningless? Were the gifts Hicks spoke about clever lies to keep us trapped? What about the visions and dreams that seemed to foretell what was coming? What about the week of psychosis and the narrator’s thousands of suggestions? Could I hold on to the trance experience in my car with Jesus and the Father, granting my deepest desire? Or were these just the crazy hallucinations and delusions of psychotic mania, shared by many people with broken brains? No one could answer these questions for me. Nor could I. Separating the truths from the lies in Hicks' teachings was like being in a large barn full of haystacks, painstakingly sifting through every little blade of grass to test if it was real or if it was a needle full of poison. Even if I could, how could I now be confident in my ability to discern truth from lie when it feels like I joined the cult with pure and good intentions, wanting a stronger relationship with God, yet He failed to protect me?
