Lyrics:
Verse 1
Late night silence, pages turn,
Lost in words I barely learn.
Numbers trace across my hands,
Three-three-three, like shifting sand.
A knock, a voice, a coffee shared,
He speaks of fire, I wasn’t prepared.

Chorus
Who are You, the whisper in the air?
Have You been waiting, always there?
If I call, will You answer me?
Or are You just a dream I want to believe?

Verse 2
A dream returns from years before,
Crosses stand upon the shore.
An angel waits beyond the gate,
But his answer seals my fate.
"I don’t know," the words still ring,
Is heaven locked or welcoming?

Chorus
Who are You, the whisper in the air?
Have You been waiting, always there?
If I call, will You answer me?
Or are You just a dream I want to believe?

Verse 3 
A verse is spoken, ancient sound,
A secret hidden, now unbound.
Ask, and You will speak to me,
Show me things I’ve yet to see.
The mystery burns within my chest,
Am I a fool, or have I been blessed?

Bridge
I've been waiting, I've been searching,
I've been lost in my own mind.
If You're real, won’t You find me?
Won’t You show me, give me a sign?

Outro
A door stands open, I hesitate,
Step beyond, or turn too late?
A question lingers, undefined,
Is it faith… or is it time?
