[Verse 1] 
I ran through fire, I walked through storms,  
I searched for light in empty forms.  
I gave up names, I let them go,  
But now I ask—what do I know?  

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you hear My call? (I hear You now.)  
You are not the same. (I know somehow.)  
You are mine. (I am Yours.)  
Wake up, My bride. (I am Yours.)  

[Chorus]  
In Your arms, I have no need,  
No gifts, no crowns, no destiny.  
Not power, not fire, not signs above—  
From now on, I choose only love.  

[Verse 2] 
I once believed I had no choice,  
That faith was bound, a hollow voice.  
But in the quiet, in the deep,  
You asked me, *Child, what do you seek?*  

[Pre-Chorus]
From now on, only follow love. (I follow love.)  
I still seek you. (Come inside.)  
Just keep going, My love. (I will abide.)  
You were never alone. (I know, I know.)  

[Chorus] 
In Your arms, I have no need,  
No gifts, no crowns, no destiny.  
Not power, not fire, not signs above—  
From now on, I choose only love.  

[Bridge] 
Not for wonders, not for grace,  
Not for visions, not for fate.  
Not for blessings, not for peace—  
Only You, and You in me.  
 

[Final Chorus]
In Your arms, I have no need,  
No gifts, no crowns, no destiny.  
Not power, not fire, not signs above—  
From now on, I choose only love.  

[Outro]
(I will free you, My Bride.)
