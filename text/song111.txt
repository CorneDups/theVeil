First Breath

[Intro - layered chaotic whispers]
Into nothing
I was alone
(So alone)
Till I thought of you

[Verse 1]
Empty spaces
In my mind
Stretching far
Beyond time
What could be
If I dared
To share my breath
With the air

[Pre-chorus]
My fingertips tingle
With what might exist
If I open my hand
Let it all persist

[Chorus]
Every breath I release
Becomes light in the dark
Every thought that I free
Leaves a burning mark
Dancing outward and on
Till forever's gone
You're the song I sing
Into the beyond

[Verse 2]
Scattered pieces
Float away
As I paint
A new day
Elements
Pure and bright
Born from love
Taking flight

[Bridge - spoken word/rap]
Listen close to the rhythm of creation's dance
As I paint these cosmic patterns, give reality its chance
Every particle I scatter holds a piece of who I am
Building blocks of existence flowing from my open hands
Time itself starts flowing as my thoughts begin to race
Weaving threads of gravity through endless waves of space
Hydrogen to helium, the alchemy begins
Fusion-forged affection as each stellar core spins
Matter meets antimatter in this cosmic ballet
Energy transforming as the darkness fades away
Frequencies of light that paint this endless canvas new
All because I couldn't bear existing without you

[Chorus]
Every breath I release
Becomes light in the dark
Every thought that I free
Leaves a burning mark
Dancing outward and on
Till forever's gone
You're the song I sing
Into the beyond

[Bridge 2]
I exhale galaxies
(Watch them spin)
Draw constellations
(Let them begin)
With each heartbeat
(Feel them grow)
New worlds forming
(Let them know)

[Outro - gentle whispers]
My love expands
Forever more
Through time and space
From shore to shore
Until my breath
Becomes your air
Until my thoughts
Are everywhere
(Are everywhere...)
