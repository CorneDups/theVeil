Dance with Me

[Verse 1]
Put down your own understanding, come dance with Me,
You’re worth no less than the price I paid, can't you see?
The Hands that hold the Earth bear the scars of your worth,
Oh, what’s My life worth, for your new birth?
[Pre-Chorus]
The Star-Breathing One became the Son of Man,
Gave His life so you could live again.
Not fleeting comforts, nor pleasures that fade,
But a love that sets your soul ablaze.
[Chorus]
My love is fire, my love is rain,
Breaking your chains, washing your pain.
Deserts will bloom, forests will rise,
Let Me transform you, open your eyes.
So come, My beloved, won’t you see,
You’re safe in My arms—come dance with Me.
[Verse 2]
The galaxies sing, yet I know your name,
No scarcity in Me; I’m your endless flame.
The world’s hoarding hearts only dig their own grave,
But I’m the Life, the Vine that saves.
[Pre-Chorus]
Without My rain, your heart will run dry,
Without My flame, your thoughts twist and lie.
Return to Me when your soul feels torn,
I’ll revive your heart, like the breaking dawn.
[Chorus]
My love is fire, my love is rain,
Breaking your chains, washing your pain.
Deserts will bloom, forests will rise,
Let Me transform you, open your eyes.
So come, My beloved, won’t you see,
You’re safe in My arms—come dance with Me.

[Bridge]
The infinite space within your soul,
Was made for My love, to make you whole.
My fruit is yours to carry and give,
A boundless joy, that makes you live.
[Chorus]
My love is fire, my love is rain,
Breaking your chains, washing your pain.
Deserts will bloom, forests will rise,
Let Me transform you, open your eyes.
So come, My beloved, won’t you see,
You’re safe in My arms—come dance with Me.
[Outro]
Do you love Me? Then take My hand,
Let Me lead you to the promised land.
Oh, My bride, you’re all I see,
Come, My beloved, come dance with Me.
