Verse 1

I walked the path, the road was long,  

A stranger’s voice became my song.  

The fire rose, the echoes called,  

But do I run, or do I fall?  


Chorus

What will it cost me, this burning desire?  

Will I be ashes, consumed by the fire?  

You call me deeper, You call me whole,  

But am I losing my body, or gaining my soul?  


Verse 2

Hands lifted high, the voices scream,  

Is this a vision or just a dream?  

Hair like a pendulum, swinging wide,  

Something is breaking, something inside.  


Chorus

What will it cost me, this burning desire?  

Will I be ashes, consumed by the fire?  

You call me deeper, You call me whole,  

But am I losing my body, or gaining my soul?  

Bridge

I prayed for truth, I prayed for light,  

But is this holy, or just the night?  

They say to stay, they say to go,  

Which way is right, I do not know…  



Final Chorus

What will it cost me, this burning desire?  

Will I be ashes, consumed by the fire?  

You call me deeper, You call me whole,  

But am I losing my body, or gaining my soul?  


Outro

Take up your cross, take up your name,  

Step into fire, never the same…  

Step into fire, never the same…
