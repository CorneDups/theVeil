At the Cross

[Verse 1 ]
The world with all its glitter and gold
Stirs up a hunger deep in my soul
Sin wraps chains around my will
And death lies waiting, silent and still

[Pre-Chorus]
But long before Your Word lit the sky
You saw the cost—love reaching so high
To breathe Your Spirit into fragile man
Would carve eternal scars in the Great I AM

[Chorus]
Oh, the Cross, the Cross, where mercy bled for me
Love poured out so fiercely, it set this captive free
The Blood of God has made a way
Proving I was worth it all
At the Cross—where chains would fall

[Verse 2 ]
The stories of old had whispered Your plan
That salvation would come by the Son of Man
They shed the blood of beasts to pardon sin
But who imagined God’s own blood stepping in?
And with my trembling hands, I swung the hammer down
As all of heaven wept, nails echoed through the ground

[Chorus]
Oh, the Cross, the Cross, where mercy bled for me
Love poured out so fiercely, it set this captive free
The Blood of God has made a way
Proving I was worth it all
At the Cross—where chains would fall

[Verse 3]
My heart keeps choosing sin—a void I cannot fill
Still the Father sees me through mercy, calling my name still
So He came down Himself to do what no man could
He loved and loved and loved, and we nailed Him to the wood

[Bridge]
Unthinkable, insane: that God would die by our hands
Darkness danced with sin and death, yet heaven had a plan
In three days, new creation rose where death had staked its claim
Resurrected life now reigns—no longer bound by shame

(Pause—brief instrumental drop, lone violin, soft heartbeat-like percussion)

[Chorus (Extended)]
Oh, the Cross, the Cross, where mercy bled for me
Love poured out so fiercely, it set this captive free
The hole in God poured healing grace,That washed my sins away
The Blood of God has made it right, no more fear of the fall
At the Cross, where He proved I was worth it all.

For this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life

(Soft, fading, echo of a whisper: "He is worth it all." x 3)
