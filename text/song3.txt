Verse 1

I wake before the morning light,  

Breathe You in, hold You tight.  

The hunger rises, the fire grows,  

A love unspoken, but my body knows.  


Chorus

How much of me must burn away,  

For You to love me, let me stay?  

I silence every thought, deny my name,  

But will the fire cleanse or leave me the same?  


Verse 2

His voice is calm, his words are kind,  

His arms, a refuge I can’t define.  

Is this devotion, or something more?  

A door I long for but can’t explore.  


Chorus

How much of me must burn away,  

For You to love me, let me stay?  

I silence every thought, deny my name,  

But will the fire cleanse or leave me the same? 

Bridge

I lay beside him, skin so near,  

A love so pure, a love I fear.  

Is this sin, or something divine?  

A shadow whispers, "You are mine." (Soft, distant echoes repeating: "You are mine.")  


Final Chorus

How much of me must burn away,  

For You to love me, let me stay?  

I silence every thought, deny my name,  

But will the fire cleanse or leave me the same?  


Outro

Take up your cross, take up your name,  

Step into fire, never the same…  

Step into fire, never the same…  

(Soft, fading, echo of a whisper: "I see you.")
