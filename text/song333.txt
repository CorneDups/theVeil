Call to Reveal

[Verse 1] 
In the depths of endless night,  
A trembling soul cried out in fright.  
Lost in shadows, fear and pain,  
I whispered, "Lord, call out my name."  

[Pre-Chorus]
A promise echoed soft and clear,  
"Call to Me, I am always near."  
Great mysteries lie in unseen light,  
To guide you through the darkest night.  

[Chorus]  
Call to reveal the secrets untold,  
Let fire, blood, and water unfold.  
In divine embrace, the veil is torn,  
A new world born from the faith reborn.  

[Verse 2] 
Through flames that scorch and cleanse my heart,  
I surrendered all, set aside each part.  
Eyes once blind now slowly see,  
The sacred map that sets me free.  

[Pre-Chorus]
In whispered prayer, the truth takes flight,  
Illuminating the endless night.  
Candles burning, incense in the air,  
The Holy of Holies reveals what’s rare.  

[Chorus]
Call to reveal the secrets untold,  
Let fire, blood, and water unfold.  
In divine embrace, the veil is torn,  
A new world born from the faith reborn.  

[Bridge] 
Do you hear My call in the silence deep?  
Amidst despair, where hopes do weep?  
The mighty things that lie concealed,  
Are gifts for hearts that will not yield.  
(Oh, in the stillness, a light appears...)  

[Final Chorus]
Call to reveal the secrets untold,  
Let fire, blood, and water unfold.  
In divine embrace, the veil is torn,  
A new world born from the faith reborn.  

[Outro]   
Now I stand, transformed and whole,  
Mysteries revealed within my soul.  
In Your light, I rise above—  
A testament to unfailing love.  

"Call to Me, and I will answer you..."
