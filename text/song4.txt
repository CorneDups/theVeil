[Verse 1] 

I walked alone, the earth stood still,  

A restless heart, a weary will.  

The numbers called, the pages turned,  

A whisper spoke, yet left me burned.  


I traced the stars, I read the signs,  

A door was open, yet confined.  

*"Come inside,"* the silence spoke,  

*"Lay your doubt beneath the yoke."*  


[Chorus]

Through fire, through blood, through waters deep,  

Through hands that broke, through nights with no sleep.  

I gave it all, I bowed, I cried—  

To find the place where You reside.  


[Verse 2]

They placed my sins upon the flame,  

I wept, I trembled, called Your name.  

The candlestick, the smoke, the wine,  

Each hunger starved, yet more divine.  


I bathed in light, I carved away,  

I watched the fire cleanse the fray.  

They broke me down, they called it love,  

And so I bled, and so I bowed.  


[Chorus]

Through fire, through blood, through waters deep,  

Through hands that broke, through nights with no sleep.  

I gave it all, I bowed, I cried—  

To find the place where You reside.  


[Bridge 1]

I laid my body on the stone, (I gave my soul.)  

I called the fire, called it home. (Take control.)  

Each tear, each hunger, made me new, (Holy fire.)  

Each name I lost, each scar I grew.  

[Verse 3]

The veil was thin, the air was bright,  

A candlestick in endless night.  

Numbers bowed, the stars stood still,  

I felt the bending of Your will.  


Equations wept, the heavens turned,  

As fire danced inside my bones.  

My breath was prayer, my steps divine,  

I saw the unseen world align.  


[Chorus] 

Through fire, through blood, through waters deep,  

Through hands that broke, through nights with no sleep.  

Yet here I stand, unchained, alive,  

For I was bound—now unbound in light.  


[Bridge 2]

Two lions guard the door I fear, (Come inside, come inside.)  

A voice is calling, drawing near. (Come inside, come inside.)  

I’ve lost so much, I’ve nothing left,  

But love remains beyond regret.  


[Final Chorus]

Through fire, through blood, through waters deep,  

Through hands that broke, through nights with no sleep.  

Yet here I stand, unchained, alive,  

For I was bound—now unbound in light.  


[Outro]

For I was lost—now I am found.  

For I was bound—now unbound.  

(Soft, fading, whispering echo: *"I will free you, My Bride."*)
