Let the Fire Speak

[Verse 1]
I saw the fire, once so bright,
But now it flickers in the night.
I trace the ashes on my skin,
Wondering how to burn again.

[Pre-Chorus]
Have I let my oil run out?
Can I still fan the flame?

[Chorus]
ğŸ”¥ Come to the flame, step into the glow! 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ I have never left, but where did you go? 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ Come to the altar, come to the light! 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ I am still burningâ€”burning inside! ğŸ”¥

[Verse 2]
I hear You call, I feel the heat,
But can I stand with unclean feet?
Refinerâ€™s flame, come purify,
Burn away what makes me hide.

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me see what needs to burn.
Show me what must die inside.

[Chorus]
ğŸ”¥ Come to the flame, step into the glow! 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ I have never left, but where did you go? 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ Come to the altar, come to the light! 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ I am still burningâ€”burning inside! ğŸ”¥

[Short interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me see what needs to burn.
Show me what must die inside.

[Bridge]
ğŸ”¥ I am the flame, I am the roar! 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ I am the fire that shakes the core! 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ Step into My mercy, step into My might! 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ You were made to burn, not made to hide! ğŸ”¥

ğŸ”¥ Let the dry bones burn! 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ Let the church arise! 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ Come awaken us again, 
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ Set Your fire in our eyes! ğŸ”¥

[Verse 3]
I surrender, take my all,
Fill this vessel, heed the call.
No more running, no more night,
Let me burn forever bright!

[Outro]
ğŸ”¥ Let the fire keep burning, never ceasing nor leaving...
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ Let the fire keep burning, never ceasing nor leaving... ğŸ”¥

(Fading echo: "Let the fire speak...")

I have come to set the world on fire, and I wish it were already burning! (Luke 12:49)

ğŸ”¥ Let the fire keep burning, never ceasing nor leaving...
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ Let the fire keep burning, never ceasing nor leaving... ğŸ”¥

(Fading echo: "Let the fire speak...")

[Verse 3]
I surrender, take my all,
Fill this vessel, heed the call.
No more running, no more night,
Let me burn forever bright!

ğŸ”¥ Let the fire keep burning, never ceasing nor leaving...
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ Let the fire keep burning...
