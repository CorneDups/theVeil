Verse 1

I closed my eyes—no, wait, they’re open,  

A thousand voices in the motion.  

They're calling, chanting, whispering low,  

Am I chosen? I don’t know.  


Chorus

Did I lose myself chasing You? (Who speaks my name?)  

Or did I lose You chasing myself? (This isn’t the same…)  

The fire burns—what is this place?  

Is this Your voice or a stranger’s face?  


Verse 2

I walk through walls, I taste the light,  

Angels screaming, bleeding white.  

Swords collide, the sky is torn,  

I was called—was I reborn?  


Chorus

Did I lose myself chasing You? (I hear them cry.)  

Or did I lose You chasing myself? (Open your eyes!)  

The fire burns—what is this place?  

Is this Your voice or a stranger’s face? 

Bridge

The dragon rises—no, it's me.  

The sky is fire—I can’t breathe.  

Who is fighting? Where am I?  

I see myself—Oh God, I—  


Final Chorus

Did I lose myself chasing You? (Voices break, heavens shake.)  

Or did I lose You chasing myself? (Am I awake? Am I awake?)  

The fire burns—what is this place?  

Is this Your voice or a stranger’s face?  


Outro 

Four stand guard—no, wait, they’re gone.  

The sky was fire—no, it was dawn.  

I lay my body, still and cold,  

But in the silence, I can’t tell…  

(Soft, fading, overlapping whispers: "Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.")
