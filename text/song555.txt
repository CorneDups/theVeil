Let the River Run

[Verse 1] x 2
Before the first dawn kissed the sky,
Before the stars knew where to shine,
The Spirit hovered, silent, deep,
And whispered light into the sea.

[Verse 2] x 2
The floodgates broke, the heavens wept,
A world undone by what was left,
Yet through the storm, a remnant sailed,
On mercy’s tide, through winds that wailed.

[Chorus] x 2
Let the river run, let the waters rise,
From the desert dry to the thirsty cries,
Let the captives dance, let the dead breathe in,
Let the church wake up and live again!

[Bridge]
Oh, let the deep call to the deep,
Let the tide pull us from sleep,
Oh, let the weary drink and stand,
Let the lost come take His hand!

[Verse 4]
I have been buried in His grave,
No longer I, but Christ remains,
The life I live, I live by faith,
In Him who loved and took my place.

[Outro] x 2
The river is running, it’s running for you...
The river is running, it’s running for you...

[Final echo]
Here is My Cup, drink deep My Bride
