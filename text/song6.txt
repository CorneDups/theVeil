Verse 1

I woke with a thousand eyes on my skin,  

Every shadow whispered secrets within.  

The wind spoke names that no one could hear,  

The walls were weeping, their voices clear.  


Pre-Chorus

I see the unseen, I breathe the untold,  

Energy moving, warm then cold.  

I touch the light, it dances wild,  

But I walk alone, the wandering child.  


Chorus

🔥 Fire and ice in my hand,  

🌊 Two worlds collide where I stand.  

🦁 The Lion roars, the cage breaks wide,  

🦋 Butterflies rise, but some still hide.  

⛓️ They tried to bind me, called me lost,  

💡 But I saw love, and paid the cost.  


Verse 2 

The sword in my grasp burns blue and red,  

I cut the chains, but I bleed instead.  

A garden of voices, a whispering tide,  

A sunflower eye, staring too wide.  


Pre-Chorus 

I reach for love, but hands pull away,  

They call me cursed, they say I stray.  

But I hear the voice, the whisper inside,  

Telling me walk, telling me fight.  


Chorus

🔥 Fire and ice in my hand,  

🌊 Two worlds collide where I stand.  

🦁 The Lion roars, the cage breaks wide,  

🦋 Butterflies rise, but some still hide.  

⛓️ They tried to bind me, called me lost,  

💡 But I saw love, and paid the cost.  


Bridge 

Then He called me, standing tall,  

A voice like thunder, like oceans fall.  

"What do you seek?" the Father said,  

I closed my eyes, bowed my head.  


"You will lose a lot, but not Me. From now on only follow love."  



Final Chorus 

🔥 Fire and ice in my hand,  

🌊 Two worlds collide where I stand.  

🦁 The Lion roars, the cage breaks wide,  

🦋 Butterflies rise… but some still hide.  


Outro

🔥 Fire and ice in my hand,  

🌊 Two worlds collide where I stand.  

🦋 Butterflies rise… but some still hide.  


(Fading whisper: "Now go… seek only love… and let it find you…")
