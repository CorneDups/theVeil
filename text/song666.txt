Lead me

[Verse 1]
You call me near, You say I’m Yours,
Yet my heart still longs for more.
The fleeting whispers, the fading fire,
Empty pleasures I still desire.
[[Verse 2]]
I run in circles, keep the score,
Stacking proof that I am Yours.
Yet all my striving leaves me dry,
And I can’t seem to qualify.
[[Pre-Chorus]]
But maybe You don’t measure me,
The way I weigh my worth in deeds.
Maybe love was always free,
And You just ask me to believe.
[[Chorus]]
So I will let go,
I will surrender.
Not to wisdom, not to gain,
But to the beauty of Your Name.
Take my burdens, take my shame,
Lead me to Your rhythm again.

[[Bridge]]
Take my hands, move them in Yours,
Take my mind, let it be restored.
Take my heart, teach it Your song,
Take my feet, and let me belong.
So I will let go,
I will surrender.
Not to wisdom, not to gain,
But to the beauty of Your Name.
Take my burdens, take my shame,
Lead me to Your rhythm again.
[[Verse 3]]
Teach me the heartbeat of Your grace,
The gentle steps, the sacred space.
Not a lesson, not a test,
Just a child in Your caress.
[[Outro]]
And when I stand before Your light,
No longer grasping, no longer tight—
I’ll move in step, I’ll finally see,
That You’ve been teaching me to dance, so free.
