Verse 1

The door was open, but I was cast outside,  

Their words like stones, their hands untied.  

They built a fire where I once prayed,  

Now I stand in the cold, watching it fade.  


Chorus

If I gave up everything for You,  

Why did You let them bury me too?  

I cut my name, I burned my past,  

But now I'm left with nothing that lasts.  


Verse 2

He spoke my name, but now it's gone,  

Their eyes once warm, now look through stone.  

I called it love, I called it home,  

But now I walk this road alone.  


Chorus

If I gave up everything for You,  

Why did You let them bury me too?  

I cut my name, I burned my past,  

But now I'm left with nothing that lasts.  

Bridge 

I carved a cross into my skin, (Did it make me clean?)  

I let them in, I let them win. (Did You ever see?)  

I was their fool, I played my part. (Did I love too deep?)  

They tore my soul, they broke my heart. (Did You abandon me?)  

(Soft, faint echo: "You were never alone.")  


Final Chorus

If I gave up everything for You,  

Why did You let them bury me too?  

I cut my name, I burned my past,  

But now I'm left with nothing that lasts.  


Outro

I was the decoy, I played the role,  

But who will save the saviorâ€™s soul?  

(Soft, fading, echo of a whisper: "I seek you.")
