The Alpha and Omega

Verse 1 – The Vision Unfolds
A trumpet sounds, the heavens break,
The veil is torn, the earth will shake.
The Lamb who died, now crowned in might,
Steps forth in robes of burning white.

[Pre-Chorus – The Throne Room]
Lightning flashes, voices rise,
Saints and elders lift their cries.
"Worthy! Worthy! Holy One!"
The war is won, the dawn has come!

[Chorus – The King is Coming] 
Behold, He rides on clouds of flame,
A King of justice, truth, and grace.
With eyes like fire, His judgment falls,
The Word that spoke now conquers all!

[Verse 2 – The Battle and Victory] 
The dragon rages, kingdoms fall,
The Beast is bound, the nations call.
The faithful stand, their robes made bright,
By crimson love and Heaven’s light.

[Pre-Chorus – The Heavenly Cry]
Winds are roaring, trumpets sound,
Every knee bows to the ground.
"Worthy! Worthy! Holy One!"
The war is won, the dawn has come!

[Chorus – The King is Coming]
Behold, He rides on clouds of flame,
A King of justice, truth, and grace.
With feet like brass, His sword divides,
He calls His own, His holy Bride!

[Bridge – The New Jerusalem]
No more sorrow, no more night,
He wipes the tears, restores the light.
The gates of pearl, the golden street,
Where heaven and earth forever meet.

[Climax – The Cry of the Saints]
Come, Lord, come! The Spirit calls,
The Bride awaits, the trumpet falls.
Come, Lord, come! We long for You,
Let all be made forever new!

[Outro – The Gentle Assurance]
(All for You, My Bride…)
(All for You, My Bride…)
(All for You, My Bride…)

[Instrumental piece]

The Spirit and the Bride cry out, 
"Come Lord, come"

[End of Song]
