Intro

The wind still moves, the sun still climbs,  

But I am lost beyond the lines.  

The road stretches, the world spins,  

But I donâ€™t know where I begin.  


Verse 1

I wake up, but I am not awake.  

I walk through days that do not break.  

Familiar faces say my name,  

But it sounds hollow, not the same.  


Chorus 

I used to be fire, I used to be light,  

Now I am ashes, drifting through night.  

I build, I speak, I move, I breathe,  

But what is left inside of me?  


Breakdown 

(Who am I?) (Who am I?)  

(Where is God?) (Where is God?)  

(Am I real?) (Am I real?)  

(Was I ever?)  


Verse 2

I plant my feet, but feel no ground,  

My voice returns, but makes no sound.  

The music plays, the seasons turn,  

But in my hands, all meaning burns.  

Chorus

I used to be fire, I used to be light,  

Now I am ashes, drifting through night.  

I build, I speak, I move, I breathe,  

But what is left inside of me?  


Bridge 

I see the road, but do not move.  

I hear my name, but do not prove.  

I hold the past, it slips like sand.  

I reach for love, but lose my hand.  

(Soft, distant echo: "Follow love.")  


Outro

The wind still moves, the sun still climbs,  

And I will walk beyond the lines.  

(Soft, fading, whisper: "Just keep going.")
