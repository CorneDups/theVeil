Eternal Light

[Verse 1]
In the beginning, before all time
The Word was with God, the Light divine
Through Him all things were formed, designed
The Life that darkness cannot confine

[Pre-Chorus]
I walked beside Him, I heard Him speak
Watched the blind man rise to see
Felt His mercy, touched His grace
Saw love pour out upon His face

[Chorus] 
He is the Way, He is the Truth
The Life that breaks the grave in two
No greater love has ever been
Than God Himself who died for men
(Jesus, my Lord, my King…)

[Verse 2]
I saw Him stand against the tide
The shepherd calling home the blind
He spoke of water never dry
And love that leads to endless life

[Bridge]
I watched Him hang, the nails, the cries
The world in darkness closed its eyes
But then I ran and found the stone
Rolled away, He rose alone!
(Hallelujah… He rose alone…)

(Pause—choir hums softly, heartbeat-like drum fades.)

[Final Chorus]
He is the Way, He is the Truth
The Life that breaks the grave in two
No greater love has ever been
Than God Himself who died for men

[Outro] 
And now I write so all may see
The Light has come to set us free
Jesus, the Lamb, the risen Son
The Word made flesh, the Holy One
“In Him was life… and the life was the Light of men.”
