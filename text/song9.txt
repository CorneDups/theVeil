Verse 1

The night was long, the road was cold,  

I lost my name, I lost my home.  

I called to You but heard no sound,  

Only echoes pulling me down.  


Pre-Chorus 

I thought You left me in the dark,  

But You were whispering through the stars.  


Chorus

So I will walk, though I don’t know how,  

I will breathe, though I don’t know why.  

I will trust, though my hands still shake,  

I will love, though my heart still breaks.  


Verse 2

I searched for truth inside the flames,  

But all I found were burnt-out names.  

I built my walls, I closed my door,  

But love was waiting on the floor.  


Pre-Chorus

I thought You left me in the dark,  

But You were whispering through the stars.  

Chorus

So I will walk, though I don’t know how,  

I will breathe, though I don’t know why.  

I will trust, though my hands still shake,  

I will love, though my heart still breaks.  


Bridge 

Two lions guard the door I fear, (Come inside, come inside.)  

A voice is calling, drawing near. (Come inside, come inside.)  

I’ve lost so much, I’ve nothing left,  

But love remains beyond regret.  


Final Chorus

So I will walk, though I don’t know how,  

I will breathe, though I don’t know why.  

I will trust, though my hands still shake,  

I will love, though my heart still breaks.  


Outro

The night is gone, the dawn is near,  

And I am home, though I still fear…  

(Soft, fading, echo of a whisper: "You were never alone.")
