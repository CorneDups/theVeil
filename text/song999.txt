Let Go

[Verse 1]
I have lived in a house of mirrors,  
Where every shadow called my name,  
Measured my worth in quiet whispers,  
Felt my silence turn to shame.  

I bent, I broke, I let them shape me,  
Like I was glass, too weak to stand,  
Every fault a scar upon me,  
Every wound a reprimand.  

[Chorus]
But I’m tired of running, tired of falling,  
Tired of begging to belong.  
I was never meant to be so hollow,  
I was never meant to prove them wrong.  

[Verse 2]  
And the echoes, they keep screaming,  
*"You are selfish, you are wrong!"*  
I was drowning in their silence,  
I’ve been fighting for too long.  

But in the wreckage, something's shifting,  
Not in anger, not in spite—  
Just a voice that whispers softly,  
*"You don’t have to win this fight."*  

[Bridge]
I do not have to shatter just to be worthy,  
I do not have to bleed just to be seen.  
I do not have to beg for love like it’s mercy,  
I am enough just being me.  

(Pause—A breath of silence before the return of soft instrumentals.)  

[Verse 3]
The mirrors don’t define me,  
The guilt no longer owns me,  
I am walking from the wreckage,  
With my heart held in my hands.  

I am unlearning fear,  
I am unraveling shame,  
I am choosing me—  
And I am free.    

[Outro]
*"I am loved… I am loved… I am loved… by the starbreathing One"*
